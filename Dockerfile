# Without these, tzdata (pulled in transitively by novnc/websockify) prompts interactively for a
# timezone at install time -- apt-get -y answers confirmations but not debconf prompts, so the
# build hangs forever with no error (found running this for real: a 2.767GB image had pulled fine,
# then apt-get sat with rising CPU and zero progress for over an hour).
