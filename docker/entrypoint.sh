# own lock file, so the next Xvfb refuses to start ("Server is already active for display 99")
# -- silently, since it's backgrounded with `&`. This leaves x11vnc with no display to attach to
# and the live view shows "Failed to connect to server" with nothing actually wrong reported.
# Removing any stale lock/socket from a prior run makes every start (fresh or restart) idempotent.
