# DECISIONS — d:/autoTesting (append-only history)

**Purpose:** the reasoned history of every design decision, experiment, and rejected approach in
AutoTester, so a later session cannot relitigate old ground without seeing why it was settled.
**Open me when:** you are about to change an approach, revive something, or need to know *why* the
system is shaped as it is. Never edit — append only via `scripts/append_decision.ps1`.
Schema: `D:/ai_os/templates/lab-protocol/DECISIONS.schema.md` (Lab Protocol v1.1: write-time status
∈ {ACTIVE, REJECTED}; SUPERSEDED is computed from later entries' `Supersedes:` fields).

## D-000 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Adopted the Lab Protocol for this repo (append-only DECISIONS, computed-status injection,
authorized state edits) on top of the maker-checker pair installed the same day.
**Why:** Umesh's explicit requirement (goal.md, 2026-09-03): the previous product (`d:/erp`) lost
human control because schema, structure, and reasoning were never written down and drifted; this
project must stay readable to a human engineer and cheap for an agent to hold in context.
**Result:** `docs/DECISIONS.md` (this file) + `docs/archive/INDEX.md` + repo-committed hooks
(`.claude/hooks/lab-*.ps1`, `decisions-append-guard.ps1`) + `scripts/append_decision.ps1` +
`.claude/settings.json` hooks merged with the maker-checker hooks. `ARCHITECTURE.md` lives at
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (plan §6 layout); the repo copy of the session-start hook falls back to it.
`qa/contracts/` + `autotester doctor` + `uv run pytest` are the validators — no separate
`contracts/verify_contracts.py` (spec'd project, not research-first data pipeline).
**Changes-authorized:** `.claude/settings.json` (hooks merge); `.claude/hooks/*` (lab + mc hooks);
`scripts/append_decision.ps1`; `qa/hooks/mc-*.ps1`; `CLAUDE.md` lab + maker-checker blocks —
enforcement wiring that lets the protocol and the pair travel with the repo.
**Approved-by:** Umesh — plan v2 (§7 Enforcement, §14 Living ledger) approved via `ExitPlanMode`
2026-09-03; maker-checker init authorized by "proceed ahead with /maker /checker" (2026-09-03).

## D-001 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Design-first build: every domain shape is a Pydantic model in `src/autotester/schema/`
(`extra="forbid"`), one concept in one place, file ≤ 300 lines / function ≤ 50, clean repo root,
all model calls through `providers.base.Provider`, prompts as files. Enforced by `autotester doctor`.
**Why:** `d:/erp` reached 232 root entries, 977 source files, duplicated concepts, and a 291-line
landmine CLAUDE.md — unreadable to humans and expensive for agents. Cheap rules now, unaffordable later.
**Result:** `qa/contracts/core-invariants.md` C1–C8; doctor + ruff + pytest green at P0 (26 tests).
**Links:** goal T-000; commit a5ffcec; contract `qa/contracts/core-invariants.md`

## D-002 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Stack and scope: Python; Gemini (key in hand) for vision/video + Anthropic SDK behind a
pluggable provider layer; first target Pathlynks; auth via `.env` credentials + persistent browser
profile with OTP as a human pause; file-based storage (JSON/JSONL per project, SQLite index later,
no Mongo for AutoTester's own state); Playwright headed by default; no LangGraph in v1.
**Why:** Umesh's answers 2026-09-03 (AskUserQuestion): Gemini key exists, Anthropic SDK preferred,
both wanted; Pathlynks is the real regression target; human-editable artifacts are the point.
File checkpoints give resumability with zero framework context cost; stage interface stays
LangGraph-node-shaped for a mechanical migration if headless-days autonomy is ever needed.
**Result:** plan v2 §1, §4, §6; provider seam + mock provider built at P0.
**Links:** goal T-000; plan §1 Decisions

## D-003 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** One credential file for the whole repo at the repo root (`d:/autoTesting/.env`), keys
namespaced per project (`PATHLYNKS_*`) and declared per project via `SecretRef[]` with domain
scope; undeclared values are masked but never resolvable. Replaces the per-project
`projects/<slug>/.env` in the first draft.
**Why:** Umesh, mid-cycle 2026-09-03: "place .env too in the root directory". Security is unchanged
(scoping comes from per-project `SecretRef.domains`; gitignore `**/.env` already covers root), and one
file is simpler to hand to a human.
**Result:** `core/paths.py::env_file` → root; contracts B1 + C5 amended by /checker (cycle 2); `.env.example` at root.
**Links:** goal T-011; verdict `qa/verdicts/t011-secret-store.md`; commit 06c614d

## D-004 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Project-wide principle: **rules answer only where they are confident; everywhere else,
spend tokens on AI judgement.** A deterministic check may decide a case only when it can be certain
(exact id, explicit link); an absent keyword hit is never treated as confidence of "no match".
First application: the feature-ledger relitigation gate reads descriptions via the LLM.
**Why:** Umesh, grill 2026-09-03 Q6: "simplistic rule-based systems fail on edge cases and give a
confident wrong answer… it is better to lose the tokens instead of betting in the wrong direction."
**Result:** encoded in `qa/contracts/living-ledger.md` L4; to be cited by later contracts
(grader, coverage diff, case expander) wherever a threshold or match is decided.
**Links:** goal T-005; grill capture `.work/grill-living-ledger.md`

## D-005 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** CONFIRM the five-artifact model (FlowSpec / Case / RawResult / Verdict + Rubric) and the observation-vs-judgement split after the T-004 schema survey; AMEND before P2 ingest locks FlowSpec, additively only: `Action` += HOVER, PRESS_KEY, SCROLL Â· `ExpectedState` += answer{exact,must_include,fuzzy}, url_match, checks[] Â· `Case` += tags[] and a `DIMENSION_BY_CLASS` lookup (WebTestBench's four dimensions over our 15 classes) Â· `Flow` += setup_flow_id Â· `FlowSpec` += app_overview Â· `RawResult` += started_at, finished_at, attempt, browser, viewport Â· `Evidence` += content_type Â· `Verdict` += known_issue_ref, case_hash. No renames, no removals; `CaseClass` stays closed; `extra="forbid"` stays.
**Why:** Umesh asked whether the schema was web-researched; it had been brain- and market-scout-derived only. Surveyed Playwright Test Agents, Gherkin, WebTestBench, Mind2Web/Online-Mind2Web, WebArena evaluators, CTRF/Allure, Momentic/Midscene (docs/research/schema-2026-09.md). None separates executor observation from grader judgement or carries per-step source provenance â€” both are ours to keep. Every gap found is at the edges (action vocabulary, answer-style assertions, timing/attempt fields, tags) and is a field each now versus a migration plus re-review of every FlowSpec later.
**Result:** amendments scheduled as part of T-060 (ingest) and T-040 (execute); interop adapters Case->Gherkin, Verdict->CTRF, WebArena task->Case+Rubric, Run->Online-Mind2Web result.json proposed for a later unit. Rejected: (a) Scenario Outline in-model (expand to concrete Cases, fold back on export); (b) collapsing Outcome+Result into one CTRF-style status (loses the independent-grader guarantee); (c) opening CaseClass (the completeness guarantee is the product).

## D-006 | 2026-09-03 | type: session | status: ACTIVE
**What:** T-005 (living map + feature ledger) built and sent to /checker; D-005 appended. Found that `scripts/append_decision.ps1` read the UTF-8 entry file with the Windows-PowerShell default encoding, so the `·` and `—` characters in D-005 are stored as `Â·` / `â€”` — read them as a middle dot and an em dash. This file is append-only, so D-005 stays as written; the script now reads and writes UTF-8 (authorized by D-000 `Changes-authorized`: `scripts/append_decision.ps1`). The upstream template copy is outside this repo and is left to the checker/inbox.
**Why:** a history file that garbles punctuation on every non-ASCII entry would rot exactly the way the ERP notes did; fixing the write path once is cheaper than a lifetime of corrections.
**Result:** this entry is the first written through the UTF-8 path — the em dash here (—) and middle dot (·) should read correctly.
**Links:** goal T-005; qa/manifests/t005-living-ledger.md; qa/feedback-inbox.md (2026-09-03 tooling-defect entry)

## D-007 | 2026-09-03 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** After every checker PASS commit, the checker pushes `origin master` itself — no confirmation asked. This replaces the prior default (push is a human decision, confirmed each time) for THIS repo only.
**Why:** Umesh, direct instruction 2026-09-03 ("but next time se tho tu khud push krr lega naa as a /checker" -> "yes wire that"): repeated per-push confirmation was friction once the repo was public and the pair's commits were already narrowly scoped and checker-verified. The confirm-first default remains the house rule everywhere else; this is a standing, explicit, repo-scoped exception.
**Result:** `CLAUDE.md` maker-checker block gets a "Push on PASS" line; the checker dispatch instructions (`maker/SKILL.md`'s prompt template is global, so this repo's own contract carries the addition instead) push after commit. Known residual: the harness-level safety classifier may still block a `git push`/`gh` call independent of this authorization — that gate is not lifted by this decision and the checker must fall back to reporting the block, exactly as today.
**Changes-authorized:** `CLAUDE.md` (maker-checker discipline block) — add the auto-push rule.
**Approved-by:** Umesh — direct instruction, this session, 2026-09-03.
**Links:** commit 04f5e3d (the manual push this rule replaces going forward)

## D-008 | 2026-09-03 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Fix `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1`'s ARCHITECTURE.md excerpt filter (AT-015): it
looked for numbered headings (`## 1.`/`## 2.`/`## 3.`/`## 6.`) from the generic Lab Protocol
template, but this project's `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` uses named headings (`## What it does`,
`## Pipeline`, etc.) and always has — every prior unit's manifest confirms this project's own
house style is named, not numbered, sections. The filter therefore matched zero lines every
session, silently injecting an empty ARCHITECTURE block. Fix: keep every section except
`## Directory map and schema summary` (mechanical, generated into `docs/MAP.md` separately, not
needed as session-start "ground truth"), instead of an inclusion allowlist keyed to numbers that
never existed in this repo. The existing 100-line cap and `[... capped ...]` message are unchanged.
**Why:** Umesh approved this batch (2026-09-03, this session, via AskUserQuestion: "AT-015/AT-028
... Yes, approve both") after the checker's sweep-found issue AT-015 confirmed via direct grep
that zero ARCHITECTURE.md headings in this repo have ever matched the hook's numbered-section
regex, so every session start has silently injected an empty ground-truth block instead of the
intended architecture excerpt.
**Result:** `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` lines ~111-124 changed from an inclusion
allowlist (`^## (1|2|3|6)[\.\s]`) to an exclusion of the one generated/mechanical section; the
injected label text updated to describe what's actually kept, not a numbered-section claim that
was never true.
**Changes-authorized:** `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` (ARCHITECTURE excerpt filter only;
no other hook logic touched).
**Approved-by:** Umesh — direct approval, this session, 2026-09-03 (AskUserQuestion batch:
"AT-015/AT-028 ... Yes, approve both").
**Links:** issue AT-015 (`qa/issues.jsonl`); qa/manifests/at015-hook-fix.md

## D-009 | 2026-09-03 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Add `scripts` to `qa/adapter.json`'s slot-1 ruff command (AT-028): was `uv run ruff
check src tests`, becomes `uv run ruff check src tests scripts`. `scripts/` was empty when the
adapter's commands were allowlisted at the START gate (2026-09-03), but now holds real production
code (`scripts/onboard_pathlynks.py`, `scripts/check_no_secrets.py`, both shipped in T-030) that
every unit's manifest has actually been linting all along — the adapter's written command was the
stale artifact, not the practice.
**Why:** Umesh approved this batch (2026-09-03, this session, via AskUserQuestion: "AT-015/AT-028
... Yes, approve both") after the checker's t080-agent-loop and at011-loop-md checks both
independently confirmed the divergence between the allowlisted command and actual practice.
**Result:** `qa/adapter.json` line 10's `cmd` updated; `CLAUDE.md`'s Commands section already
reads `uv run ruff check src tests` too and gets the same `scripts` addition for consistency.
**Changes-authorized:** `qa/adapter.json` (slot-1 verify command only) and `CLAUDE.md` (Commands
section, to match).
**Approved-by:** Umesh — direct approval, this session, 2026-09-03 (AskUserQuestion batch:
"AT-015/AT-028 ... Yes, approve both").
**Links:** issue AT-028 (`qa/issues.jsonl`); qa/manifests/at028-adapter-fix.md

## D-010 | 2026-09-03 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Raise `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1`'s ARCHITECTURE.md excerpt cap from 100 to
150 lines (AT-029) — a correction found while fixing AT-015 under D-008. D-008's own committed
text said the cap was "unchanged," which became inaccurate the moment AT-015's broadened filter
(keep every named section except the generated directory map) needed more than 100 lines to
avoid truncating mid-file. D-008 is append-only and cannot be edited to reflect this; this entry
is the correct, explicit authorization the checker's cycle-2 verdict required
(`qa/verdicts/at015-at028-hook-adapter-fix.md`, AT-030).
**Why:** Umesh's original batch approval for AT-015 (2026-09-03, AskUserQuestion: "AT-015 (a
session-start hook injects an empty ARCHITECTURE block every session)... Approve both as one
routine batch?" → "Yes, approve both") authorized fixing AT-015 completely — a hook that still
truncates before reaching real content (Design rules/Commands/Status) has not actually fixed the
empty-injection bug, only partially. The cap value itself is not arbitrary: 150 matches
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s own C2 line-budget ceiling, so the excerpt (after excluding the one
generated section) can never exceed the source file's own maximum — a true ceiling, not an
active truncator under normal conditions.
**Result:** `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` line ~126: `$keep.Count -ge 100` → `-ge 150`,
label text updated to say "capped at 150 lines". Independently re-verified by extracting the
literal code block from the file on disk and executing it against the real
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: 139 lines kept, no truncation, all 10 headings present through `## Status`.
**Changes-authorized:** `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` (the cap value on the ARCHITECTURE
excerpt filter only — same file D-008 already authorized, this entry names the specific
additional line D-008's text did not cover).
**Approved-by:** Umesh — the original AT-015 batch approval, this session, 2026-09-03
(AskUserQuestion: "AT-015/AT-028 ... Yes, approve both"), explicitly extended here to cover this
necessary correction to deliver that same approved fix, per the checker's requirement
(AT-030) that the authorization be named explicitly rather than assumed from D-008.

(Cycle checked: 2, FAIL); qa/manifests/at015-at028-hook-adapter-fix.md

## D-011 | 2026-09-03 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Correct the authorization record for the ARCHITECTURE-cap raise (100→150 lines) in
`.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` — D-010's `Approved-by` line recycled the old AT-015/AT-028
batch-approval quote with an "explicitly extended here" assertion instead of quoting the actual
fresh, cap-specific approval exchange that happened this session. D-010's code/text is otherwise
accurate and is NOT re-litigated; this entry supplies the missing verbatim authorization only,
per the Lab Protocol's append-only rule (D-010 itself is never edited).
**Why:** Checker cycle-3 verdict (`qa/verdicts/at015-at028-hook-adapter-fix.md`) filed AT-031:
D-010's stated authorization did not match what the maker's own dispatch narrated as having
happened. The `/agent-debugger` diagnosis (`qa/debug/at015-at028-hook-adapter-fix-cycle3.md`)
confirmed this is an execution gap, not a process ambiguity — D-008/D-009 already modelled the
correct verbatim-quote pattern two entries earlier in the same file — and named "append a new
D-011 that directly quotes the real fresh approval exchange" as the routine, low-risk recovery.
**Result:** The real exchange, verbatim, from this session (AskUserQuestion, 2026-09-03):
Question: "Separately: the hook fix for AT-015 needed a follow-on correction (raising an
injection cap from 100 to 150 lines) that the checker says needs its own explicit sign-off, not
just an extension of your original 'approve both' batch answer. Approve this specific cap
change?" — Answer selected: "Yes, approve the cap change." This IS the specific, fresh, cap-only
approval AT-031 required; D-010's underlying code fix (the cap value, 150, matching
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s own C2 budget) stands unchanged and correct.
**Changes-authorized:** none (this entry corrects the authorization record only; no file besides
`docs/DECISIONS.md` itself changes as a result of D-011).
**Approved-by:** Umesh — direct answer, this session, 2026-09-03, quoted verbatim above.

## D-012 | 2026-09-05 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Rewrite every hook command in .claude/settings.json from `powershell -Command "$i=[Console]::In.ReadToEnd(); & \"$env:CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR\...\" -InputJson $i"` to `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .claude/hooks/<script>.ps1` for: decisions-append-guard.ps1, lab-session-end.ps1, lab-session-start.ps1. No hook script changes; the scripts already read stdin when -InputJson is empty.
**Why:** Claude Code executes hook commands through bash -c on this machine, which expands `$i` and `$env:...` to empty strings before PowerShell parses the command. Every hook in this repo has therefore failed with a parse error on every invocation since it was installed (evidence: `hook_non_blocking_error` records in the session transcripts; AIOS decisions/log.md 2026-09-05). The append-only DECISIONS guard, the session-start protocol snapshot and the /landplane reminder have never actually run here. Run with -File, the repo copies work (verified in D:/KnowledgeBase on 2026-09-05: lab-session-start injects the snapshot with a RECOVERY warning; decisions-append-guard denies a direct edit).
**Result:** Enforcement becomes live from the next session. The /init-lab template in the AIOS carries the same fix (templates/lab-protocol/project-settings.template.json, commit d2d93a4) so new repos are correct.
**Changes-authorized:** .claude/settings.json (hook command strings only; matchers, timeouts and entries unchanged)
**Approved-by:** Umesh
**Links:** AIOS decisions/log.md 2026-09-05 (two entries: machine-wide hook fix; Lab-repo finding); memory reference_hook_commands_run_under_bash

## D-013 | 2026-09-05 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Sync the committed hook scripts decisions-append-guard.ps1, lab-session-start.ps1 to the AIOS Lab-Protocol template (D:/ai_os/templates/lab-protocol/hooks, commit of 2026-09-05): JSON output is now ASCII-escaped before it is written. Behaviour otherwise unchanged.
**Why:** Under the harness PowerShell writes stdout in the OEM codepage; non-ASCII characters copied from ARCHITECTURE.md / DECISIONS.md into the session-start snapshot became 0x1a bytes inside the JSON string and Claude Code rejected the payload (raw-text fallback + a hook_non_blocking_error per session). Observed in this repo's live session on 2026-09-05 right after the hook commands were rewired (see AIOS decisions/log.md).
**Result:** The session-start snapshot and the append-guard reply are accepted as JSON; no more error records.
**Changes-authorized:** .claude/hooks/decisions-append-guard.ps1 , .claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1 (byte-identical to the AIOS template)
**Approved-by:** Umesh
**Links:** AIOS decisions/log.md 2026-09-05 (ASCII-escape addendum); hook-fixtures.ps1 'lab-session-start under chcp 437'

## D-014 | 2026-09-07 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Additive schema amendments for Track A (learn from recordings), per the approved plan (plan.md section 4) and the answered AT-052 gate. (1) Discharge D-005 items: `Action` += BACK, HOVER, PRESS_KEY, SCROLL (execute.py gains a `.get()` guard so an unhandled action is ERRORED, never a KeyError); `FlowSpec` += app_overview. (2) Move ObservedStep/ObservedFlow/ObservedScreen/VideoObservation from schema/flowspec.py to new schema/observation.py and extend them (t_end, url, purpose, fields, ui_elements, screenshot_ts; on_screen_text, narration; exit_screen; issues[], summary, open_questions) plus VisionOptions and ModelObservation. (3) New artifact kinds, each a schema model + ProjectPaths property + ProjectStore method, plain JSON/JSONL under projects/<slug>/ (C6): Transcript + MediaPrep (schema/media.py), VideoAnalysis (schema/analysis.py), Issue (schema/issue.py), ScreenMap (schema/screenmap.py). (4) Screen += source_ref; Source += recorded_on. (5) New closed vocabularies: IssueCategory (12 prior-art categories + feature_gap, wrong_model, data_error), IssueOrigin, IssueStatus, Confidence. `CaseClass` stays closed -- Issue is a separate artifact (D-005's rejection stands). Media prep is host-side ffmpeg/faster-whisper via subprocess; every model call stays behind providers.base.Provider; prompts stay files.
**Why:** Umesh 2026-09-07: "product map, Test cases, issues excel and product flow end to end. like all maximum learning we can take." VideoObservation cannot carry issues, urls, fields or screenshot moments, and nothing persists what a video taught the system. Ground truth is dominated by spoken change requests (10/33 "Feature gap" rows) which the prior taxonomy has no home for. Additive now vs a re-review of every FlowSpec later (D-005's own reasoning). Corrected fact: erp1/2/3.mp4 are scored against ERP_Issues_Trainers.xlsx (7 rows); the 33 rows of ERP_Issues_ALL.xlsx belong to other recordings.
**Result:** units T-130..T-136 build on these; A1 (T-130) is schema-only. Plan of record copied into the repo as plan.md (allow-listed in doctor's root rule) so the backlog never again lives only outside the repo.
**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Pipeline, Concept-to-file table, Storage, Commands, Status -- unit A6); qa/contracts/ingest.md (I6-I9); new qa/contracts/video-learning.md (VL1-VL8); qa/contracts/coverage.md no-fire amendment; qa/contracts/report-export.md scope note; .gitignore (chunks/, frames/ under projects/*/sources/*/); src/autotester/doctor.py ALLOWED_ROOT_ENTRIES += plan.md.

## D-015 | 2026-09-07 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Build the autonomous explorer as a NEW stage stages/explore.py (+ explore_node.py, explore_safety.py, explore_merge.py, screen_identity.py) under its own contract qa/contracts/explore.md; execute.md E5 stays intact -- run_case never invents an action, the explorer is the one place that does. New model families schema/screen_graph.py (ElementRef, PageObservation, ScreenNode, ScreenEdge, CrawlFrontier, ScreenNaming) and schema/crawl.py (CrawlBounds, SafetyPolicy, DialogEvent, CrawlIssue, Crawl); enums NodeStatus, EdgeOutcome, IssueKind, CrawlStatus. New browser modules browser/observe.py (+ enumerate.js) and browser/launch.py (launch_options moved verbatim out of session.py, which is at its C2 cap). Screen identity = content_id over (templated URL path + structural signature of non-row interactive elements), never URL alone and never an LLM description. Artifacts under projects/<slug>/crawl/<crawl_id>/ as JSONL; shots/ gitignored. Rejected: extending Provider.act with images for vision-guided crawling -- the crawl is DOM-driven and deterministic; a model is optional and only names screens.
**Why:** Umesh 2026-09-07: "mere bhaai ye sab tho honaa mandatory"; blast radius "jo jo uss account mai access hoga vo krr lengee" (gate at052 answered). The prior attempt failed on URL-only identity (SPAs invisible), an LLM-text stop condition that never fired, beforeunload dialog traps, GA noise reported as issues, and coverage from "did the script run" -- each is designed against in explore.md X1-X12.
**Result:** units T-140..T-145 (B1, B2, B4, B3, B5 in that order, then the live ERP demo). B4 (safety) lands before B3 (crawl) so a crawler never exists in this repo without brakes.
**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md concept-to-file row for the explorer (offset by folding the Pathlynks onboarding row into the scripts row; file stays at 150 lines) and Storage line; .gitignore projects/*/crawl/*/shots/; qa/contracts/explore.md (new, checker-owned); execute.md E2 and browser-and-secrets.md routine amendments after B1; coverage.md V1 after B5.
**Approved-by:** Umesh -- plan approved 2026-09-07 (plan.md section 5).

## D-016 | 2026-09-07 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Project.write_policy is enforced at runtime for the first time, by the explorer only (stages/explore_safety.py), as an INNER guard inside Umesh's outer boundary (the test account's own permissions). For crawler-invented actions: READ_ONLY -- destructive-name deny-list ON, form-submit controls never clicked, nothing typed. TEST_ACCOUNT -- deny-list ON, submits allowed, nothing typed. ALLOW_WRITES -- deny-list OFF, submits allowed, nothing typed. At every policy: logout/sign-out never clicked; unnamed non-link controls skipped and counted (D-004: a rule decides only where certain); the human-authored login case run via run_case is the only pre-crawl form submit; beforeunload is accepted, every other dialog dismissed, more than dialog_repeat_limit dialogs on one node aborts the node; host re-check after every action (off-domain -> go_back, else goto base_url); failed requests are issues only when first-party, third_party_ignore hosts dropped, other third parties counted as noise. No allowed_domains wildcard. Test accounts carry no 2FA (Umesh 2026-09-07); real user accounts (which do) are never used.
**Why:** write_policy has been declared and defaulted since T-000 and read by zero code. The target is production (no staging named), so the default is the tightest policy; ALLOW_WRITES is Umesh's switch. The TEST_ACCOUNT row is the maker's interpretation, shown once in the B4 manifest for confirm-or-edit.
**Result:** SafetyPolicy defaults in schema/crawl.py; tests/test_explore_safety.py; explore.md X5-X9.

## D-017 | 2026-09-08 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** AutoTester gains a second TARGET KIND. Today a target is a web product reached through a browser and judged on its screens; Track C adds a target reached through an API endpoint or a codebase -- an LLM application -- judged on its outputs. New models schema/ai_target.py (AiTarget, Signal) and schema/ai_check.py (AiCheckKind, AiCheck); new stages discover.py, read_context.py, ai_catalog.py, ai_capture.py, adversarial.py; new checker-authored contracts qa/contracts/ai-target.md and qa/contracts/adversarial.md. Discovery signals are DETERMINISTIC (grep and file inspection): SDK imports, prompt-template files, agent-framework usage, tool/MCP registrations, retrieval use, presence of ground truth, presence of a live endpoint. A model may NAME the system kind from those signals; it may never CHOOSE which checks run -- that mapping is a table in code, the same discipline D-015 used to keep action choice out of the model's hands for the crawl. C7 is preserved: ai_capture.py and adversarial.py exercise the target and never grade it; judgement goes through stages/grade.py with a Rubric. A context folder (including an Obsidian vault) is read as ordinary structured markdown -- frontmatter and tags only; backlinks, Dataview and live-vault features are out of scope. Rejected for now: vendoring Garak/PyRIT/DeepTeam as hard dependencies -- their value here is their probe corpus, so probe sets live in prompts/probes/*.md and a ProbeSource adapter behind the provider seam is designed for and built ONLY if the native sets prove too thin.
**Why:** Umesh 2026-09-08, choosing "adopt the cheap parts + a Track C for AI-system testing" over adopting the reference material's cheap patterns alone, after being shown that the reference describes testing AI systems' outputs rather than web screens. Vidysea's own products carry LLM features a browser cannot grade, so the north star -- a human tester and AutoTester get the same material, AutoTester wins on bugs found, false positives and time -- applies unchanged to them. Building this as a second target kind rather than a separate tool reuses the provider seam, the grade stage, the redaction boundary, the Catalog and the report exporter.
**Result:** units T-150..T-155 (governance, discovery+classification, check registry+matching, behavioural checks, bounded adversarial pass, report). Track A keeps tick priority; Track C advances on ticks where Track A waits on a checker. If Track A slips again, Track C is the track to pause -- it is the only one with no human ground-truth sheet waiting on it.

## D-018 | 2026-09-08 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** (1) Consent becomes an ARTIFACT, not a habit. New schema/approval.py::RunApproval (target, scope, bounds, granted_by, granted_at, expires_at, run_kind) and core/consent.py::require_approval, content-addressed so an approval cannot be widened after the fact. Gate 1 covers read scope (a discovery scan outside the project); gate 2 covers every outward-facing run -- the live crawl and, above all, the adversarial pass, whose approval must name the exact endpoint and a probe count at or above the planned run. An adversarial run against a production endpoint requires the approval to say production explicitly. Without a matching unexpired approval the runner sends nothing and exits non-zero. (2) T-145's done_check, currently {"cmd": "true"} -- a check that cannot fail, on a HIGH-criticality high-user-value live-crawl task (filed by the 2026-09-08 sweep as AT-100) -- is replaced by a command asserting both the crawl's exit code and a matching approval row. (3) qa/adapter.json's verify allowlist is widened to the commands checkers already legitimately run: the proof scripts (scripts/*_proof.py), docker inspect, git show, md5sum, and checker-authored probe scripts under .work/.
**Why:** the reference material's two consent gates are a better articulation of what write_policy and the HUMAN_GATE files reach for informally, and the explorer is about to be pointed at a live production ERP (T-145) with a done_check that cannot fail. Firing adversarial prompts at an endpoint is outward-facing and can cost money, trip a vendor's abuse detection, or pollute a production log; it is the one capability in the plan that must be impossible to start by accident. The allowlist is widened rather than enforced-as-written because it is currently narrower than honest practice -- every recent verdict ran commands outside it, so as written it makes each real check a silent CONTRACT_MISMATCH.
**Result:** units T-124 (consent gates + the T-145 done_check replacement) and T-126 (adapter allowlist, governance debt); the refusal criteria in qa/contracts/adversarial.md; a pre-crawl approval check in stages/explore.py.
**Changes-authorized:** qa/adapter.json verify.commands; .goal/goal.json T-145 done_check; qa/contracts/explore.md amendment for the pre-crawl approval (checker-owned); new qa/contracts/adversarial.md (checker-owned).

## D-019 | 2026-09-08 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Restore the two locally-authorized changes to `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` that commit 051303e (D-013) reverted as an unintended side effect, and add the regression test whose absence let this happen twice. (1) The ARCHITECTURE.md excerpt filter goes back to D-008's rule -- keep every `## ` section EXCEPT `## Directory map and schema summary` (generated into docs/MAP.md separately) -- instead of the generic Lab Protocol template's numbered-heading allowlist `^## (1|2|3|6)[\.\s]`, which matches nothing in this repo because this project's ARCHITECTURE.md has always used named headings. (2) The excerpt cap goes back to D-010's 150 lines, with the label text saying 150. (3) NEW `tests/test_session_start_hook.py` reads the real .ps1 and asserts the authorized constants are present and that the filter, applied to the real docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, keeps every named section. (4) This file is now DELIBERATELY NOT byte-identical to the AIOS template: any future template sync must re-apply these two local deltas, and this entry is the record that says so.
**Why:** AT-097 (high, found by the 2026-09-08 checker sweep). D-008 and D-010 are both ACTIVE and both carry Approved-by: Umesh; D-010's Result names the exact line and value. The disk disagreed with both. Bisected: 5f83bdb cap=100 numbered-filter -> f9e3456 cap=150 named-filter (the authorized fix) -> 051303e cap=100 numbered-filter (the revert). 051303e is D-013, whose own Changes-authorized says "byte-identical to the AIOS template" and whose What says "Behaviour otherwise unchanged" -- so the revert was neither intended nor recorded, and D-013 carries no Supersedes line. Measured on disk 2026-09-08 by executing the on-disk filter against the real docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (150 lines, 11 named headings): it keeps exactly ONE line, the H1 title. Every session started since 2026-09-05 has been injected an empty ground-truth block -- AT-015 fully regressed, inside the very hook whose job is to make the protocol survive forgetting. Deliberately NOT expressed as **Supersedes:** D-013: D-013's actual purpose (ASCII-escaping hook JSON output, which fixed a real harness rejection) is correct, still in force and must stay ACTIVE; marking it SUPERSEDED would tell every future reader to discard a fix that is load-bearing. What is replaced is only its "byte-identical to the template" treatment of this one file, which is stated above rather than encoded as a supersession that would misreport the rest.
**Result:** the session-start hook injects real ground truth again; a pytest fails if either constant is reverted, so a third silent regression is not possible. AT-097 and AT-029 close together -- AT-029 (the cap firing before Design rules/Commands/Status) is the same defect's other half.
**Changes-authorized:** .claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1 (ARCHITECTURE excerpt filter + cap only; the ASCII-escaping from D-013 is untouched); new tests/test_session_start_hook.py.
**Approved-by:** Umesh -- STANDING authorization D-008 and D-010, both ACTIVE and both Approved-by Umesh, which authorize precisely these two values. This entry restores their effect and creates NO new authority; it does not approve anything Umesh has not already approved. Flagged to him in the tick report as a change made to an enforcement path without a fresh approval, so he can reverse it in one commit if he disagrees.

## D-020 | 2026-09-08 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Correct `.claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1` line 118 from `Join-Path $root "ARCHITECTURE.md"` to `Join-Path $root "docs\ARCHITECTURE.md"`, so the session-start hook reads the architecture file this project actually has. Remove the strict xfail in tests/test_session_start_hook.py that pinned the defect, leaving the path assertion live. This closes AT-097 and AT-029 (the excerpt filter and the 150-line cap restored under D-019 were correct but were repairing code that never executed) and AT-106.
**Why:** AT-106, found by the checker on the D-019 unit. The hook has looked for ARCHITECTURE.md at the REPO ROOT since the genesis commit; this project has always kept it at docs/ARCHITECTURE.md and `git log --all --diff-filter=A -- ARCHITECTURE.md` is empty, so a root copy has never existed. Executing the real hook emits "[WARN] ARCHITECTURE.md missing at repo root" and injects ZERO architecture headings. The sibling line 50 already reads "docs\DECISIONS.md", so the missing docs\ prefix on line 118 is a plain oversight inconsistent with its own file. This is an enforcement-path VALUE that no prior entry authorizes -- D-008 and D-010/D-011 name the filter and the cap and say nothing about the path -- and this repo has FAILED two checks (AT-030, AT-031) for treating a batch approval as covering a specific value by extension, so it was gated rather than extended onto D-019.
**Result:** the session-start hook injects real ground truth for the first time in this repo's history: 0 headings -> all 10 named sections. AT-097, AT-029 and AT-106 close together. The strict xfail is removed in the same commit; it existed precisely so this fix could not land while a stale xfail hid it.
**Changes-authorized:** .claude/hooks/lab-session-start.ps1 (the $archPath value only; the D-013 ASCII-escaping and the D-008/D-010 filter and cap are untouched); tests/test_session_start_hook.py.
**Approved-by:** Umesh -- asked directly 2026-09-08 via an AskUserQuestion presenting three options (fix the path / move ARCHITECTURE.md to the root / close as won't-fix) with the diff and the blast radius of each; he chose the path fix.

## D-021 | 2026-09-09 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Replace this repo's permission posture so routine maker-checker work stops raising approval prompts. (1) Add a `permissions` block to `.claude/settings.json`: `allow` = the three tool-level grants `Bash`, `Edit`, `Read`; `deny` = 13 destructive rules (sudo, ssh, chmod 777, rm -rf on root/home, git push --force, gh repo/release delete). The hooks block is untouched. (2) Machine-wide, OUTSIDE this repo and recorded here only because it is what actually unblocked this project: `D:/ai_os/.claude/hooks/edit-in-place-guard.ps1` no longer treats a stem ending in a digit as drift, and its allow-list gains `.work`, `scratchpad`, `temp\claude`, `.playwright-mcp`, `.goal`, `qa`, `brainstorms`. It still asks on `_v2`/`_new`/`_copy`-style duplicates in real source trees, which is the anti-drift rule the user CLAUDE.md asks for.
**Why:** Umesh 2026-09-09, twice, escalating: approval prompts were costing hours and stalling the loop. Four causes, all measured, none of them "auto mode is off" -- `permissions.defaultMode` was already `auto` throughout. (a) The machine-wide drift guard returned permissionDecision "ask" for ANY source file whose stem ends in a digit -- and a hook "ask" cannot be overridden by any permission mode, so auto mode was powerless against it. FORTY-EIGHT files in this repo's `.work/` match that shape (run2.py, patch18.py, probe5.py, s5.py, p6.py), and the guard's allow-list covered `tests/` and `fixtures/` but not `.work/`, which this project's CLAUDE.md REQUIRES scratch to live in. Every checker subagent writes probe scripts, so every checker prompted. (b) Compound `cd X && cmd` chains require EVERY segment to match a rule, so an approved `Bash(python run2.py forms)` still prompted for the `cd` -- clicking yes never helped. (c) `Write(path)` rules are accepted and NEVER consulted; `Edit` is the canonical file-modification namespace, so several previously-approved rules bought nothing. (d) The 108-entry user allow-list was hyper-specific literals accumulated by clicking, which generalise to nothing.
**Result:** scratch writes and `cd X && cmd` chains no longer prompt; a `_v2` duplicate in `src/` still does. Verified by a before/after harness driving the real hook with valid JSON: the old hook asked on all three scratch cases, the patched one is silent on all three, and both still ask on `src/analyze_video_v2.py` and `src/ingest_new.py`. Known residual, stated rather than hidden: `~/.claude/settings.json` is rewritten from memory by the running session, so user-level grants only become live after a restart or `/permissions` -- a first attempt was reverted byte-identically within 20 seconds. Rollback: `.work/permfix-backup/*.bak`.
**Changes-authorized:** .claude/settings.json (permissions block only; the hooks block is untouched).
**Approved-by:** Umesh -- asked directly 2026-09-09 via an AskUserQuestion presenting three breadth options (broad-for-workflow / maximum / surgical) plus a second question on the drift guard's fate; he chose "Maximum -- stop asking almost entirely" and "Scope it to real source trees", and then approved the written plan twice, including after a mid-course correction.

## D-022 | 2026-09-09 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Reconnect EXPAND and COVERAGE to a human, closing AT-239, AT-240, AT-241 and AT-250 (T-135, "Track A6: coverage/merge/expand loops reconnected"). Five wires, no stage rewritten: (1) `cli.py` gains `autotester expand <project>` -- the first production caller of `stages/expand.py::expand`, which persists the generated cases through `ProjectStore.add_case` (the caller's job per expand.md's own no-fire list, not the stage's). (2) A new `ui/routes_learn.py` carries the operator-facing half of the same loop: `GET /projects/{slug}/flowspec` renders the FlowSpec for review, `POST .../flowspec/approve` and `POST .../flowspec/request-edit` are the review gate's two directions with a signer, `POST /projects/{slug}/cases/generate` is the UI's Generate-cases button, and `GET /projects/{slug}/requests` is the video-request queue -- the first surface on which the product's "ask the human for a video" promise is visible to the human it asks. (3) `stages/coverage.py` gains `queue_requests(store, gaps)`, one place that turns gaps into deduped persisted `VideoRequest`s; `unreached_screens` is deliberately NOT wired into it (coverage.md V5 forbids it). (4) `ui/routes_runs.py::trigger_run` calls it on the run's own `RawResult`s via `diff_coverage`, and (5) `ui/routes_crawls.py::start_crawl` calls it on the finished crawl's nodes via `diff_crawl`. Refusals on the new UI routes render as themed pages, not raw JSON (the AT-244 class, not fixed for the pre-existing routes here). REJECTED in this unit: making `expand()` persist its own cases (breaks expand.md's no-fire and its purity), and firing coverage from a GET page render (a read would then write).
**Why:** the business-truth campaign (`qa/verdicts/business-truth-campaign-2026-09-09.md`, VERDICT: FAIL, 4/10 business requirements met) measured the consequence of a gap this repo already knew about: `expand`, `diff_coverage`, `request_for` and `ProjectStore.add_request` had zero production callers, so across four projects the product holds 52 cases of which 49 are `happy` and no case has ever been generated (AT-250), and a `VideoRequest` has never been produced. Every contract passed and every unit PASSed while the two stages the north star rests on were unreachable. T-135 was already pending, which is the point: the wire, not the stage, was the missing work.
**Result:** T-135's unit `t135-reconnect-expand-coverage`; T-100 reopened to `pending` because the campaign disproved its own acceptance note ("full onboarding -> report without touching the CLI") live in a browser (AT-241).
**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (Pipeline section -- name the entry points each stage is reached from; Concept-to-file table -- the expand/coverage rows and a row for ui/routes_learn.py; Status section); new src/autotester/ui/routes_learn.py; stages/coverage.py (additive `queue_requests` only -- V1-V5 functions byte-unchanged); .goal/goal.json T-100 status.

## D-023 | 2026-09-10 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Expand AutoTester's product contract from its current video-first and bounded-crawl
foundations into one reusable, project-agnostic testing loop. A project intake accepts a URL,
domain-scoped credential references, optional user evals/conditions/business rules, and optional
video/audio/document/text/email or Google Drive sources. With teaching material, AutoTester learns
and reconciles the stated flows; without it, AutoTester authenticates and explores breadth-first.
Both paths converge on a durable Portal Persona, traceable best/worst/edge evals, regression runs,
and unified HTML/Excel/screenshot reporting. "Complete exploration" means the actionable BFS
frontier was exhausted or a named safety/budget bound stopped it; skipped, denied and unreached
actions remain visible and can never be presented as covered. Register T-160 through T-169 for
this missing product layer. Existing Tracks A, B and C remain foundations rather than being
reimplemented.
**Why:** Umesh corrected the active goal on 2026-09-09: the directory must accept any project's
URL and test-account credentials, optionally learn from user-provided evals, use cases, recordings
or Drive material, otherwise explore the whole portal using the portal-explorer discipline, avoid
single happy-path DFS behaviour, preserve the learned portal persona and workflows, and act as
post-development damage control with clear issues, diagrams, text and screenshots. The current
goal tracker contains working parts of this design but has no explicit owner for Drive and generic
source intake, learn-or-explore orchestration, durable portal persona generation, API-derived
evals, release-triggered regression or final two-mode acceptance. Its 69 percent therefore
overstates progress against the corrected objective until these tasks are registered.
**Result:** `plan.md` gains the revised product layer and acceptance sequence; `.goal/goal.json`
gains T-160..T-169 and a north star that names both taught-input and credentials-only modes.
Every new task carries a task-specific command or rubric that can fail. Implementation remains
maker -> manifest -> independent checker -> PASS/fix cycle -> commit -> push -> post-push browser
validation. Brain guidance applied: bounded iterative loops, durable checkpoints and evaluation at
component/workflow/application levels. Portal-explorer guidance applied: browser-first operation
plus a durable Quick Re-Run/Profile/flow/findings/change-history artifact.
**Changes-authorized:** `plan.md` (additive revised-product-layer section), `.goal/goal.json`

## D-024 | 2026-09-10 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Implement T-161 as one no-CLI onboarding form over the existing Project, SecretRef,
Source and ProjectStore concepts. The form accepts the base URL and allowed-domain boundary,
zero or more domain-scoped credential key declarations, optional user evals, conditions/business
rules and use cases, plus optional source declarations. Raw credential values remain outside the
artifact path and are entered only through the existing masked credentials editor. All submitted
fields are validated before project or source persistence so a malformed intake cannot leave a
partial project. Source declarations become canonical Source rows rather than a second intake-only
registry; T-162 remains responsible for fetching and adapting Drive, audio, documents and email.
**Why:** D-023 and the active goal require any project to begin from one operator form, while the
current onboarding stores only name, URL and domains and then makes the operator hand-assemble
credentials, rules and sources across separate pages. Reusing the existing typed artifacts keeps
the UI a thin file-backed editor and preserves the secret boundary and one-concept-one-place rule.
**Result:** T-161 owns the typed project intake fields, onboarding rendering/parsing and canonical
source registration, with an end-to-end TestClient acceptance suite and independent headed-browser
checker proof. Later tasks consume these inputs; this unit does not claim orchestration or adapters.

## D-025 | 2026-09-10 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** T-161's unified onboarding form accepts both domain-scoped credential declarations and
their optional values in the same submission, in addition to URL, user evals, conditions/business
rules, use cases and source declarations. Values are atomically written only to the repo-root
gitignored `.env`; Project stores SecretRef keys/scopes and Sources store non-secret statements.
The whole submission is parsed and validated before any file write. Repeated source statements
are content-addressed and idempotent. Source adapters/fetching remain T-162.
**Why:** The active product goal says the user fills one form with URL and account credentials.
D-024 kept values on a later Credentials page, preserving safety but failing that actual one-form
experience. Atomic batch persistence is safer than sequential field writes because an invalid
second credential cannot leave a half-configured account, while the same SecretStore boundary
still prevents values entering project artifacts, prompts, logs or rendered responses.
**Result:** One browser form can create a credentials-only project or a richly taught project
without CLI or JSON editing; the existing later credentials page remains available for rotation.
**Supersedes:** D-024 -- the earlier split-page credential approach is removed because it missed
the user's one-form requirement; atomic secret-only persistence is both more faithful and safer.

## D-026 | 2026-09-18 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** `doctor`'s checks are split by what they read. `src/autotester/doctor.py` keeps the rules
over SOURCE -- line caps, function length, banned filenames, root clutter, duplicated concepts --
plus `Violation` and `run()`. The rules over the project's own RECORDS -- `check_ledger` and
`check_qa_issue_rows`, with `ISSUE_ID`, `_MARKER_LEAD` and `_is_marker_line` -- move to a new module
`src/autotester/ledger/checks.py`, inside the existing `ledger` package rather than as a new
top-level concept. `run()` imports them function-locally, the idiom `doctor.py` already used for
`ledger.render` and `ledger.store`, so no import cycle is created by `checks.py` importing
`Violation`. Behaviour is unchanged; the split is the whole change.
**Why:** Three consecutive units (AT-496, AT-500, AT-504) grew `doctor.py` from 264 to 287 lines
against C2's 300-line cap, and all three landed in the record-rules half. `doctor` itself would not
have said a word until 301, so the file was one ordinary unit away from failing its own rule with
no warning -- the checker filed AT-506 for exactly this. The seam is real rather than arithmetic:
the two halves read different trees (`src/` and `tests/` versus `docs/FEATURES.jsonl` and `qa/`)
and answer different questions (did the code stay readable, versus did the project's account of
itself stay true). Splitting on a line count alone would have been drift with a cap for an excuse.
**Result:** `doctor.py` 287 -> 204 lines, `ledger/checks.py` 105, `tests/test_doctor.py` 282 -> 133,
new `tests/test_ledger_checks.py` 165 -- every file with real headroom. Behaviour proved identical
by a fingerprint of both checks over the live `qa/` corpus AND over a copy with five ledger rows
deleted (11 violations across 11 artifacts), byte-identical before and after. The mutation coverage
of the three units that built these rules is proved to have survived the move by re-running their
falsifying edits against the new module path; the closed units' own evidence files are deliberately
NOT rewritten, because they document what was verified at the commit they were verified at.

## D-027 | 2026-09-18 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Remove the hand-maintained `## Status` section (lines 146-150) from
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. It duplicates the job `docs/SNAPSHOT.md` already does -- generated,
always fresh, explicitly routed for exactly this ("the whole project in one screen -- what is
live and why ... what is next") -- and it had drifted false: it claimed "the P0-P5 goal backlog
is closed" while `.goal/goal.json` currently carries 10+ `pending` tasks (T-122, T-123, T-136,
T-145, T-125, T-126, T-150-T-153) and `docs/SNAPSHOT.md`'s generated "Next (open goal tasks)"
section lists five of them. No information is lost: what the section tried to say is already
covered, correctly and automatically, by `docs/SNAPSHOT.md`, which `CLAUDE.md`'s router already
points to for this exact purpose. This is the only prose in the file found to be genuine,
safely-removable redundancy (see Why for what was measured and rejected).
**Why:** AT-507 -- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` sits at exactly its 150-line C2 budget (doctor.py
`check_architecture_budget`, `ARCHITECTURE_MAX_LINES` in `ledger/render.py`) with zero headroom,
so the next prose change has nowhere to go. Measured before choosing a fix, per AT-506's own
precedent (D-008/D-010 raised this same budget 100->150 once already, and D-026 shows the file
has been edited at the cap via pure row-swaps ever since): (1) the file has NO generated content
of its own to deduplicate -- the "Directory map and schema summary" was already split out to
`docs/MAP.md` at genesis (commit 2785312) specifically to stay under this budget, so all 150
lines are already hand-written prose, not a generated/prose mix `doctor` could discount; (2) the
34-row "Concept -> file" table is concept-oriented and does not literally duplicate `docs/MAP.md`
(module-oriented, 117 rows) -- verified every one of its 41 referenced file paths resolves on
disk, none stale; (3) the `## Commands` section overlaps 4 of 7 lines with `CLAUDE.md`'s own
Commands section but is not a literal duplicate (different flags: `pytest` vs `pytest -q`, `ruff
check src tests` vs `...tests scripts`) and carries 3 commands (`map`, `snapshot`, `ledger add`)
`CLAUDE.md` does not -- removing it would delete information, and fixing the overlap needs an
edit to `CLAUDE.md`, which is out of this unit's file set (a second build subagent owns it
concurrently); (4) hard-wrapped paragraphs (e.g. the FlowSpec/Execution-model/Security prose)
could be collapsed onto single physical lines to cut the raw newline count, but that is a fake
saving -- it does not reduce the character/token cost an agent actually pays reading the file,
which is the reason C2 exists, so I rejected it as gaming the line-count proxy rather than
fixing what it stands in for. Net measurement: the `## Status` section is the only place where
removing lines removes zero real information (it is redundant with, and already contradicted by,
a generated doc) -- 5 lines recovered at the same 150-line budget. This is smaller than a
budget-raise would buy, but it directly answers the stated problem (zero headroom) without
touching `doctor.py`'s cap, and per the task's own framing a raise is legitimate only for what
trimming fails to recover -- trimming was not skipped here, it was attempted, measured, and
found to have exactly one safe target. Not raising the budget in this unit; if the table keeps
growing by one row per unit, that is arithmetic, not drift, and can be re-measured next time it
recurs (as D-026 recorded for `doctor.py`'s own cap).
**Result:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` 150 -> 145 lines. `docs/MAP.md` and `docs/SNAPSHOT.md`
regenerated (`uv run autotester map`, `uv run autotester snapshot`) and unchanged byte-for-byte
except SNAPSHOT's own `Last decisions` tail (D-027 added). `uv run autotester doctor` ends clean.
No code or test changes -- the budget constant is untouched.
**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (the `## Status` section only, plus the trailing
blank-line cleanup it leaves); docs/MAP.md (regenerated only); docs/SNAPSHOT.md (regenerated
only); qa/manifests/at507-architecture-doc-regains-its-headroom.md.

## D-028 | 2026-09-18 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Correct D-027's `**Result:**` line count. D-027 said `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` went
"150 -> 145 lines"; the actual, applied edit (removing the blank line before `## Status` along
with the section itself, six physical lines total, not five) produced 144 lines. D-027's code
change and its choice of what to remove are correct and are NOT re-litigated; this entry supplies
the accurate line count only, per the Lab Protocol's append-only rule (D-027 itself is never
edited) -- the same pattern D-011 used to correct D-010's authorization text.
**Why:** Re-counted `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` immediately after applying D-027's edit as part of
AT-507's own verification step, before running `doctor`: `wc -l docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` reports 144,
not the 145 the entry's Result line states. The discrepancy is a one-line arithmetic slip made
while drafting the entry (miscounting the blank separator line as staying) rather than a
different edit being applied -- the file on disk matches D-027's `**What:**` and
`**Changes-authorized:**` exactly.
**Result:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` is confirmed at 144 lines (150 - 6), 6 lines of headroom under
its 150-line C2 budget, not 5. No file changes as a result of this entry beyond `docs/DECISIONS.md`
itself.
**Changes-authorized:** none (this entry corrects the D-027 record only; no file besides
`docs/DECISIONS.md` changes as a result of D-028).
**Links:** D-027; AT-507; D-011 (the precedent for this correction pattern)

## D-029 | 2026-09-21 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Amend D-016's typing column and `qa/contracts/explore.md` X10/X5 for one narrow,
approved surface: the AutoTester explorer MAY fill post-login forms with SYNTHETIC values
(fixed, non-PII generator output) under the `TEST_ACCOUNT`/`ALLOW_WRITES` write policy, on the
Pathlynks dev environment only, with the standing prohibition on destructive actions (delete,
permanent or irreversible changes) unchanged. At every other policy level (`READ_ONLY`,
production targets, any other project until its own gate answers), X10's "nothing is typed"
remains exactly as it was. Authorization source: Umesh in chat 2026-09-21, verbatim: *"what is
actually login form and details like apni best intelligence se system ko fill krr lena chahiye
like auto tester kya krta hai, they cases and cases various different combinations ki like usse
hota kya hai and next time kis aur ways se kr ke dekhta hai"* — recorded in
`qa/gates/post-login-forms.md` (option b), which this entry cites as its authorization source.
**Why:** The gates `post-login-forms.md` and `live-crawl-target.md` (opened 2026-09-17 and
2026-09-16 by checker sweeps) were both answered by Umesh on 2026-09-21: Pathlynks is the first
live end-to-end crawl target, and its coverage holes that sit behind submitted forms (search
results, created records, wizard steps) are unreachable under the absolute typing ban, leaving
V7 coverage permanently partial for no safety gain on a dev-environment test account. The ban's
original purpose (D-016) was to stop the crawler mutating a real product it does not
understand; synthetic generated values on a test account in a dev environment keep that
purpose intact while letting the explorer observe what a form actually does — which is the
north star's own best/worst/edge combination behaviour Umesh explicitly asked for. The
destructive-action prohibition and the per-run RunApproval consent gate (D-018) are NOT
relaxed by this entry; every live form-typed run still passes consent gate 2.
**Result:** `qa/contracts/explore.md` X10 and the X5 matrix are amended by the checker (critical
amendment, its write surface) to encode the X10-b rule: typing allowed ONLY under
TEST_ACCOUNT/ALLOW_WRITES + synthetic values + dev-environment target + non-destructive;
violations of any one of those four conditions remain refusals. The first live use is the
Pathlynks stage-2 form-exploration crawl after the READ_ONLY map crawl. Until that amendment
lands, no typed run is authorized.
**Changes-authorized:** qa/contracts/explore.md (X10 + X5 amendment only, by the checker);
qa/gates/post-login-forms.md (already updated with the Answered line); no code files.

## D-030 | 2026-09-21 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Landplane recovery of 88 uncommitted working-tree changes left by prior sessions'
closed ticks and checker runs. Committed: (1) 75 `qa/evidence/` files — checker evidence from
nine PASSed units (at500, at521, browser-at435/446/452/455/457/458, 458-c2/c3, 459, 459-c2/c3),
the same committed asset class as the 335 evidence files already tracked; (2) the two generated
`.goal/` tick files (dashboard.html, goal.json); (3) `projects/pathlynks/approvals.jsonl` — the
D-018 gate-2 per-run consent records; (4) five small demo/validation project dirs referenced by
tests and contracts (`projects/{xssprobe,saucedemo,checkerdemo,t161-final-smoke,t161-pushed-live}`),
matching the existing per-project metadata precedent (erp/pathlynks/regression-demo/vidysea-erp).
Ignored via .gitignore (Changes-authorized below): `.codex/` (another agent tool's local hook
config — T-161's own checked-PASS manifest classifies it a runtime artifact); `projects/*/sources/`
(transcripts, observations, analysis of ERP tester videos — the standing rule bars transcripts and
product internals from the public repo; same class as recording.*/chunks/frames);
`projects/*/sources.jsonl` (the erp registry labels carry the recorded trainer's name);
`projects/*/screenmap.json` and `projects/*/issues.jsonl` (portal-explorer outputs on a real
product — internal screen structure and found issues; the D-015 rationale verbatim).
**Why:** The session-start hook printed `[RECOVERY] 88 uncommitted change(s)` and the Lab
Protocol requires the tree landed before new build work. Classification was by class evidence,
not case-by-case taste: evidence dirs are a committed class (335 tracked files; these 13 dirs are
checker runs of PASSed units); .goal tick files are tracked and were modified by the last tick;
approval records are the audit trail for live runs; demo project dirs are referenced by
`tests/test_migrate_url_patterns.py` and `qa/contracts/explore.md`. The ignored set was measured
first: erp transcripts quote the trainer's spoken words on ERP internals ("CIPSA certificate we
should mention CITS certificate"); erp sources.jsonl labels name the person recorded;
screenmap/issues map the real ERP. Committing any of these would put student-surface product data
in a PUBLIC repo (github.com/umeshsugara-ai/autoTesting).
**Result:** All five new ignore patterns verified with `git check-ignore -v`; the staged tree
contains only the committed classes above. Verification gate on the staged tree:
`uv run pytest` -> PASS (per-module sweep: 100+ files, all green; full-suite run times out under the 10-min shell cap -- per-module evidence in .work/parallel-watch.md); `uv run ruff check src tests scripts` -> PASS (all checks passed);
`uv run autotester doctor` -> PASS (doctor: clean). DECISIONS staged diff verified additions-only.
No code changed; no contract or ARCHITECTURE prose edited; no enforcement path touched.
**Changes-authorized:** .gitignore (the five pattern additions above only); the recovery commit
itself (qa/evidence/*, .goal/*, projects/* as classified, projects/pathlynks/approvals.jsonl).
No Approved-by required (no enforcement path in scope).

## D-031 | 2026-09-22 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Correct `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`'s "Execution model" section to describe the system
that actually exists. Today it claims: "**Per case: script-first** (run the durable Playwright
script if one exists) â†’ agent fallback ... on success the agent emits a script. So a stable
suite costs ~zero tokens to re-run; the agent only pays for new or broken cases." None of that
exists: `Script` (`src/autotester/schema/case.py:87`) is never instantiated in `src/`;
`case.script_ref` (`:31`) is declared and copied through, never read for behaviour;
`stages/agent_loop.py::run_with_fallback` has zero production callers â€”
`stages/run_case_pipeline.py:95`, `stages/explore.py:109` and the UI all call
`stages/execute.py::run_case` directly. Every re-run today is a fresh vision-graded run.
Verified independently by the 2026-09-22 sweep (AT-540's fold; verdict
qa/verdicts/sweep-2026-09-22.md) and by the TestSprite research audit
(docs/research/testsprite-2026-09.md, Â§7 row 1 â€” filed as AT-253's re-verification).
**Why:** Under the Lab Protocol, generated docs must not claim behaviour the code does not
have; a false execution model misleads every reader (human or agent) who plans work on top of
it, and it blocks the upcoming script-first wiring unit (D-entry for that unit will cite this
correction as its prose baseline). The replacement prose describes today's reality: per case,
`run_case` performs the steps in a real browser and produces a RawResult; judgement belongs
entirely to the independent grader (`stages/grade.py`); there is no durable-script replay and
no token amortization yet â€” that is the design goal of the queued script-first unit, not a
shipped fact. The `Script` schema and the unwired `run_with_fallback` are described as
scaffolding for that queued unit.
**Result:** The "Execution model" section is rewritten to: (1) per-case execution = `run_case`
direct, producing RawResult; (2) grading = independent stateless judge, multimodal;
(3) an honest "Not yet built" sentence naming script-first replay + agent fallback as the
queued wiring unit's goal (AT-253 answered: wire, not retire â€” Umesh 2026-09-22). No other
section changes. The concept-to-file table row for agent fallback is reworded to
"unwired (queued)" so MAP and ARCHITECTURE agree.
**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (the "Execution model" section only + the one
concept-to-file table row's wording).

## D-032 | 2026-09-22 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE
**What:** Make the executor's deterministic assertion layer real (AT-540, adoption B of
docs/research/testsprite-2026-09.md). Today `ExpectedState.absent_text/dom_asserts/visual_signal/
network` (schema/flowspec.py:65-68) have zero read sites in src/, `Action.ASSERT` is
`lambda session, step: None` (stages/execute.py:43), and `BrowserSession._poll_for_expected`
(browser/session.py:238-251) is a settle hint that returns normally on timeout, recording no
failure. 100% of pass/fail judgement is an LLM reading a screenshot (stages/grade.py:123).
**Why:** Umesh approved assertions-first (2026-09-22): the grader's opinion on a screenshot is
currently the only oracle in the system, and a deterministic assertion is the cheapest defence
against both false PASSes and false FAILs. TestSprite ships an explicit `type: "assertion"`
plan-step class; we have the schema for one and no implementation. This does NOT break C7
("the executor never grades itself", qa/contracts/core-invariants.md): an assertion result is
EVIDENCE â€” a recorded fact about the DOM/URL at a moment in time â€” and `grade.py` still owns
the Verdict. What changes is that the grader will now have deterministic facts to weigh, and a
`RawResult` whose own recorded assertions failed can no longer be graded PASS without the
grader contradicting recorded evidence (grade.py's existing self-consistency/downgrade logic
already distrusts evidence-contradicting verdicts; this gives it real evidence to contradict).
**Result:** (1) New `BrowserSession.assert_expected(expected, timeout_ms)` â€” evaluates the
deterministic fields (`url` contains, `visible_text` present, `absent_text` truly absent,
`dom_asserts` selectors exist) by polling like `_poll_for_expected`, records each result as
`EvidenceKind.DOM` evidence with an explicit `assert <field>: met|unmet (<detail>)` label, and
raises nothing â€” the executor reads the recorded results and decides outcome-only consequences:
an unmet assertion on a step's own `expected` or on an `Action.ASSERT` step makes `run_case`
return a new `Outcome.ASSERTION_FAILED` (a fourth observation, not a judgement: it states a
declared expectation did not hold, which is observation, not grading). (2) `Action.ASSERT`'s
handler evaluates `step.expected` through the same method (a no-expected ASSERT records
`assert: nothing expected` DOM evidence and stays harmless). (3) `network` stays
observer-derived (PageObserver already records NETWORK evidence; no per-step wait is added) and
`visual_signal` stays the judge's (E1's existing no-fire line). (4) The execute.md contract is
amended by the checker (E1's "never compares the captured evidence against Step.expected" line
is superseded by this D-entry; E1's three-outcome list gains ASSERTION_FAILED; the
"executor only observes" line is reworded to "the executor never grades â€” a declared
expectation either held or did not, and the grader still owns the verdict"). (5) ARCHITECTURE.md's
corrected Execution-model section (D-031) gains one sentence: deterministic assertions are
evidence; the grader still owns every verdict.
**Changes-authorized:** src/autotester/schema/enums.py (Outcome.ASSERTION_FAILED);

## D-033 | 2026-09-22 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Add narrow, outage-safe allow rules to `.claude/settings.json` so this project's `/maker`
loop survives an auto-mode classifier outage. Rules added: `Bash(uv run pytest*)`,
`Bash(uv run ruff check src tests scripts)`, `Bash(uv run autotester doctor)`,
`Bash(powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/append_decision.ps1 *)`, and
`Bash(python D:/ai_os/scripts/delegate_unit.py *)`. The bare `Bash` allow stays for normal use but is
inert in auto mode (dropped as over-broad).

**Why:** In Claude Code auto mode every tool call is classified by a model; when that model is
unavailable the call fails closed. Measured across all transcripts: 837 such refusals, 16 of them
`ScheduleWakeup` — a silently dead loop. Only NARROW allow rules resolve before the classifier and
survive an outage (proven under `CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_MODE_MODEL=does-not-exist`). This repo currently has
only a bare `Bash` allow, which auto mode drops — so during an outage its whole loop freezes (the
D-088 failure elsewhere: `append_decision.ps1` itself could not run). The rules above are the verify
commands from `qa/adapter.json`, the decisions-appender, and the delegation entrypoint — each a
narrow, argument-scoped form, never a wildcard interpreter. Cross-ref: `D:/ai_os/umesh/decisions/log.md`
2026-09-22 "Auto-mode classifier outages".

**Result:** the five rules are present in `.claude/settings.json`, and a forced-outage harness
(`CLAUDE_CODE_AUTO_MODE_MODEL=does-not-exist`, then a bogus base-URL model) confirms the verify
commands and `append_decision.ps1` run under the outage while a non-allowlisted command still blocks.
Evidence recorded in `D:/ai_os/umesh/decisions/log.md` after the validation run.

**Changes-authorized:** `.claude/settings.json` (add the five narrow allow rules above; no deny-list
or hook change).

**Approved-by:** Umesh (chat, 2026-09-22 — "Haan, D-entry + settings karo").

**Links:** D-088 (the outage failure that prompted this), `D:/ai_os/umesh/decisions/log.md` 2026-09-22

## D-034 | 2026-09-22 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** ACCEPT (option A) that the owner-only local credential editor may render saved secret
values. `GET /settings/providers` and the per-project env editor serve the real saved credential
VALUE behind a show/hide toggle so the operator can verify and edit it; this is a deliberate,
authorized exception to the credential boundary, not a leak to fix (AT-554). No src/ change; the
behaviour stands, and test_ui_settings.py::test_settings_page_shows_the_stored_value_masked +
test_ui_env_editor.py remain green as its codification.

**Why:** Checker live-browser validation (2026-09-22,
qa/evidence/browser-live-checker-2026-09-22-checker/report.json) confirmed a live GEMINI_API_KEY value
in the raw HTML of the settings page. Read literally against core-invariants.md C5 ("masked from logs,
prompts, and artifacts") that was a boundary violation with no authorizing entry. But the AutoTester UI
runs owner-only on 127.0.0.1 for the operator who already owns .env, so showing the saved value to that
same operator is not an exposure to anyone new. The boundary's core intent is unchanged and still
enforced: a secret value never reaches a MODEL, a LOG, a SHARED/committed artifact, or a captured
PRODUCT screenshot (core.redact.Redactor.scrub and contract B7 stay exactly as they are). Residual,
accepted knowingly: the value reaches the local operator's own HTTP response, DOM, and any screenshot
of the settings/env page -- such a screenshot must never be fed to a model or shared; the checker's own
live-browser snapshots that captured it are gitignored and were deleted.

**Result:** core-invariants.md C5 gains an owner-only-editor exception bullet + amendment-log row;
browser-and-secrets.md gains a clarifying amendment-log row (B7 substance unchanged); AT-554 flips to
`wontfix` (accepted by decision, not a code fix). The full suite stays green (1534 passed, 0 failed at
HEAD a30f535) and ruff + doctor clean.

**Changes-authorized:** qa/contracts/core-invariants.md (C5 only -- the exception bullet + amendment-log
row, by the checker); qa/contracts/browser-and-secrets.md (amendment-log clarifying row only; B7
substance unchanged). No src/ or test change.

## D-035 | 2026-09-22 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Finalize `qa/contracts/source-adapters.md` from gate-A-approved DRAFT to an active,
checker-owned contract. No wording changed from the draft the maker authored at intake; this entry
is the authorizing D-record the contract's own header requires before its DRAFT status can be
lifted.

**Why:** The contract was authored as a review artifact from `qa/gates/t162-contract-approval.md`,
answered **(A) Interview now** by Umesh in chat 2026-09-21 (source-kind phasing: TEXT+DOC+AUDIO in
phase 1, DRIVE+EMAIL as phase 2; Drive OAuth device flow, not service-account; audio Gemini-first
via the existing Provider seam with Whisper as no-API fallback; email limited to local .eml/.mbox,
no mailbox credentials). T-162 phase-1a (the adapter seam + TEXT + DOC) was then built against this
draft and checker-PASSed (`qa/verdicts/t162-source-adapters-1a.md`, cycle 1): SA1 (one `Source`
model, one `sources.jsonl`, `SourceKind.TEXT`/`SourceKind.DOC` reused from the existing enum, no
second store or parallel enum), SA2 (sha256 content-addressed dedupe, tested and mutation-proven),
SA4 (extraction addressable by `Source.id`), SA5 (honest `extraction_error` degradation for a
corrupt `.docx`, a DOCTYPE-bearing `.docx`, and an undeclared-dependency `.pdf` — never silent empty
text), and SA6 (no `Provider` parameter anywhere in the seam — a model cannot be called, structurally,
not just by convention) are all evidenced by a passing test suite (11/11 unit tests,
1549 passed/0 failed across the full repo suite) and by 4/4 capability-coverage rows independently
reproduced by the checker in a throwaway copy (single-hunk falsifying edit -> named test reddens for
the claimed reason -> revert -> green). A contract that already governed a checker-PASSed unit is no
longer merely a review artifact; leaving its header at DRAFT after that point would misstate its own
status to the next reader.

**Result:** `qa/contracts/source-adapters.md`'s header changes from "DRAFT for Umesh's review" to
active/checker-owned, citing this entry; no criteria (SA1-SA6), phase-1/phase-2 scope split, or
no-fire list text changes. T-162 phase-1a is `checked-PASS`.

**Changes-authorized:** `qa/contracts/source-adapters.md` (header status line only, by the checker —
this is a contract, not an enforcement path).

**Approved-by:** Umesh — the contract's substance was approved via `qa/gates/t162-contract-approval.md`
Option A, chat, 2026-09-21 (the four verbatim design answers quoted there); this entry records that
approval as the contract's authorizing D-record per its own header requirement.

## D-036 | 2026-09-23 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Build T-163, the resumable learn-or-explore orchestrator, and promote DISCOVER + MODEL to
named canonical stages. Add `schema/run_state.py` (RunState + StageCheckpoint + a StageName enum) and
`stages/orchestrate.py::run_or_resume`. Use the existing per-stage filestore artifacts (T-020) as the
durable checkpoint substrate — no LangGraph / database dependency is added. Resume = re-enter the first
stage whose artifact is missing (the checkpoint's status is not done/skipped). Entry-path selection is
recorded on RunState (`mode`: teaching Sources present -> learn/INGEST; absent -> explore/DISCOVER via
the existing bounded-BFS crawl). Both paths converge on MODEL (FlowSpec assembly) and PROPOSE into a
DRAFT spec, stopping at the existing review gate (`stages/review.py::require_reviewed`); merge uses the
existing `merge_flowspec` which already resets to DRAFT (F-035) and refuses to discard an APPROVED spec
(F-037). Add a new contract `qa/contracts/orchestrator.md` (OR1-OR6) and take it DRAFT->ACTIVE on the
unit's checker PASS. Default run keying: one run_id per invocation, sequential per project (a later
superseding entry can widen to concurrent same-project runs if the operator needs it).

**Why:** The T-16x reusable-platform roadmap (D-023) named T-163 as the orchestrator that promotes
DISCOVER/MODEL; T-162 (all source adapters) is now done, clearing its last dependency. Reusing the
strongest thing already built — durable artifact-per-stage persistence — instead of introducing an
orchestration engine keeps the change small, keeps the human-reviewed-truth invariant that F-035/F-037
already enforce, and makes DISCOVER/MODEL first-class per the approved roadmap. Design grounded in the
operating brain (concepts/langgraph/persistence.md checkpointer+resume model; concepts/langgraph/hitl.md
draft-review archetype) — see `.work/t163-orchestrator-design.md`.

**Result:** Pending build. On checker PASS: `schema/run_state.py` + `stages/orchestrate.py` land,
`qa/contracts/orchestrator.md` goes ACTIVE, and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` Pipeline + execution-model
sections gain the `{INGEST | DISCOVER} -> MODEL -> ...` framing (regenerated within the 150-line budget).

**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md ("Pipeline" and the stage-execution paragraph — add
DISCOVER/MODEL and the resumable-run framing, kept within the 150-line budget) · qa/contracts/orchestrator.md

## D-037 | 2026-09-23 | type: fix | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Add `EnterWorktree` and `ExitWorktree` to `permissions.allow` in `.claude/settings.json` so
auto-mode approves them without a human click. These tools were NOT allowlisted, so when a parallel
build subagent used `EnterWorktree` to relocate into its worktree, auto-mode fell back to a permission
prompt; with nothing running between turns, the T-163 build sat frozen on that prompt for ~3 hours
overnight. The two build briefs are also hardened to forbid the worktree tools and run verify via the
already-allowlisted `Bash` tool (defense in depth), but the allowlist is the durable fix: a gated tool
must never be able to silently kill the maker loop.

**Why:** Umesh reported the freeze directly (screenshot of the `EnterWorktree` prompt) and asked why the
loop waited all night despite permissions being granted. Root cause: the standing allowlist covered
`Bash`/`Edit`/`Read` and specific commands, but not the worktree tools the parallel-wave pattern relies
on. Allowlisting them removes the only human-click dependency in the otherwise self-driving build loop.

**Result:** `permissions.allow` gains `"EnterWorktree"` and `"ExitWorktree"`. The frozen T-163 build was
stopped and re-dispatched with the tools forbidden; it completed (commit 6cad8e0, ready-for-check).

**Changes-authorized:** .claude/settings.json (permissions.allow: add EnterWorktree, ExitWorktree).

**Approved-by:** Umesh

## D-038 | 2026-09-23 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Build T-164, the durable Portal Persona. Add `schema/portal_persona.py` (a Pydantic
`PortalPersona` model: profile, auth shape, screens, transitions, taught flows, gotchas, screenshot
refs, and a dated `history` list) and a stage `stages/portal_persona.py` that BUILDS/UPDATES the
persona from a crawl's screen graph (screen_graph.py/screenmap.py) + the reviewed FlowSpec, persisting
it as a durable cross-run artifact at `projects/<slug>/portal_persona.json` (the T-020 filestore) and
regenerating the human-readable `projects/<slug>/knowledge.md` page from it. Cross-run means: a later
run MERGES into the existing persona (new screens/transitions/flows appended, never silently dropping
prior knowledge) and records a dated `history` entry with a change summary (change detection). Add a
new contract `qa/contracts/portal-persona.md` (criteria PP1-PPn), DRAFT->ACTIVE on the unit's checker
PASS. This does NOT change the canonical pipeline in ARCHITECTURE.md — the persona is a durable
artifact and a stage, documented via the generated MAP/SNAPSHOT, not a new pipeline stage.

**Why:** The T-16x reusable-platform roadmap (D-023, milestone M9) named T-164 as the durable Portal
Persona: today portal-explorer knowledge is per-crawl scoped and lost between runs. T-163 (the
resumable orchestrator) is done, so a run now has a stable place to build/update the persona from.
Making the persona durable + versioned is the substrate T-166 (eval compiler) and T-167
(release-triggered regression) later read from.

**Result:** Pending build. On checker PASS: `schema/portal_persona.py` + `stages/portal_persona.py`
land, `qa/contracts/portal-persona.md` goes ACTIVE, and each run updates a durable persona +
knowledge page with dated history.

**Changes-authorized:** qa/contracts/portal-persona.md (new, DRAFT->ACTIVE on this unit's checker
PASS). No ARCHITECTURE.md prose change (generated MAP/SNAPSHOT reflect the new module).

**Links:** T-164, T-160/D-023 (roadmap M9), T-163/F-045 (orchestrator, the run substrate now cleared),
D-036 (the filestore-as-durable-store precedent this reuses).

## D-039 | 2026-09-24 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Authorize building T-125, the test catalog, exactly as `plan.md` §5A specifies. It adds a
pure stage `stages/catalog.py::catalog(project, spec, store) -> Catalog`, a schema
`schema/catalog.py` (`CatalogEntry`, `Catalog`, enum `BlockedReason` with the closed vocabulary
`no_flowspec`, `flowspec_not_approved`, `missing_credential`, `no_ground_truth`, `needs_write_policy`,
`no_live_endpoint`), and a `tier` for each `CaseClass` (`static` -> `behavioural` -> `adversarial`) so runs go
cheap-to-expensive. It also adds a read-only page `GET /projects/{slug}/catalog`. Add a new contract
`qa/contracts/catalog.md` (criteria CT1-CTn). /checker authors it from §5A as DRAFT, and it goes
DRAFT->ACTIVE on this unit's checker PASS.

**Why:** `stages/expand.py` generates cases without saying which ones can actually run. A tester then
sees a case count that silently includes cases blocked on a missing credential, an unapproved
FlowSpec or a write policy. The catalog makes "what is runnable now, what is blocked, and the one
action that unblocks it" explicit. T-152 (Track C check registry) and T-166 (traceable eval compiler)
both depend on T-125 and must reuse this one Catalog, never a second one. T-125 has been ready since
D-023 registered it, but no contract existed, so no maker could build it.

**Result:** Pending build. On checker PASS: the catalog stage, schema and page land, and
`qa/contracts/catalog.md` goes ACTIVE. `tests/test_catalog.py` and `tests/test_ui_catalog.py` are
the registered done_check. No ARCHITECTURE.md prose change: the catalog is a derived view over
existing artifacts, reflected in the generated MAP/SNAPSHOT, not a new pipeline stage.

**Changes-authorized:** qa/contracts/catalog.md (new, authored by /checker as DRAFT, DRAFT->ACTIVE on
this unit's checker PASS). No ARCHITECTURE.md prose change.

**Links:** T-125; plan.md §5A; D-023 (registered T-125, Approved-by Umesh 2026-09-09); T-152; T-166;

## D-040 | 2026-09-24 | type: decision | status: ACTIVE

**What:** Widen T-165 in place and register two split-out units, following the crawl-reuse spike
(`docs/research/crawl-reuse-2026-09.md`).
- **T-165** keeps BFS frontier completeness and adds the following:
  - a traversal `strategy: bfs | hybrid`. Hybrid means BFS maps the portal, then a bounded DFS goes
    deep through each workflow, using Crawljax's depth-first candidate ordering ported as fresh
    Python (Apache-2.0, idea only, no code copied).
  - form-input replay: `_replay_discovery` re-issues a discovering step's `fill` values, not only
    its click.
  - an incremental crawl: the frontier is seeded from `portal_persona.json`, and a screen whose
    `(url_template, structural_signature)` matches the stored `PersonaScreen.signature` is skipped
    (Stagehand cache-key pattern, MIT, idea only).
  - change tracking: a persona revision records new, changed, missing and broken screens and flows.
    This extends `portal_persona.py::_merge` beyond add-only PP2 and feeds T-168.
- **T-170 (new, built first, no dependency on the traversal work):** first-party API/network
  assertions during a crawl or run. It ADOPTs Playwright `page.on('response')` (already a
  dependency). T-165's original "first-party API/network assertions" clause moves here.
- **T-171 (new):** permission-surface coverage. Every control the role can reach is either
  exercised or listed as blocked with a reason. Writes happen only under `write_policy=TEST_ACCOUNT`
  plus a per-run `RunApproval`, and destructive actions are ordered last.
- **Parked:** a Playwright Test Agents healer spike. Its internals are not public, so it is not
  blocking.

**Why:** Umesh, 2026-09-23 (qa/feedback-inbox.md): "video is optional, i also have to explore by
itself. and apart from bfs do dfs also … saving the website schema and flow … so the next time it
really need to retrace everything … agar koi chiz break ya update hogi tho vo bhi track ho", and
"jo account mai dunga usme jitni permission hogi utni tho testing ho hi jaani chaiyee". The hybrid
strategy is explicitly NOT a revival of D-023's rejected single happy-path DFS: BFS still maps the
whole portal, and the DFS is bounded per workflow. Splitting T-170 and T-171 out keeps T-165
checkable in one cycle. T-170 has no reuse candidate to wait on, so it ships value first.

**Result:** Pending build. T-165 stays critical (dual check). T-170 and T-171 are registered in
`.goal/goal.json`: T-170 has no dependency on T-165, and T-171 depends on T-165. T-166 now depends
on T-165 and T-170. Contracts: `qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md` (new, T-165) and
`qa/contracts/network-assertions.md` (new, T-170) are authored by /checker as DRAFT and go
DRAFT->ACTIVE on each unit's first checker PASS.

**Changes-authorized:** docs/ARCHITECTURE.md "Pipeline" section: add one line naming the explore
traversal strategy (bfs | hybrid) once T-165 PASSes. qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md and
qa/contracts/network-assertions.md (new, checker-authored DRAFT). .goal/goal.json: register T-170
and T-171, and widen T-165's note and done_check.
