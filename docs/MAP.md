# AutoTester — map (generated sections; do not edit between markers)

**Purpose:** the directory map (every module's one job, from its docstring), the schema summary (every model, from its docstring), and the `scripts/` inventory (every instrument's one job, from its docstring or header comment) — derived from code by `autotester map`.
**Open me when:** you need to find which module owns a job, which model holds a shape, or which script does what (AT-520: `scripts/` used to be invisible to every routed doc). `autotester doctor` fails when this file is stale.

| `PersonaProfile` (`schema/portal_persona.py`) | What the product is, at a glance — the durable header of the persona. |
| `AuthField` (`schema/portal_persona.py`) | One credential input the login SHAPE has. Carries the SecretRef KEY, never |
| `AuthShape` (`schema/portal_persona.py`) | How the product authenticates, described by shape alone (PP5): which |
| `PersonaScreen` (`schema/portal_persona.py`) | One distinct screen the product has. Accumulated across runs (PP2). |

| `PortalPersona` (`schema/portal_persona.py`) | The durable, cross-run model of one product under test (PP1). A single |
| `SecretRef` (`schema/project.py`) | A declared credential. Holds the KEY and its scope — never the value. |
| `ProviderConfig` (`schema/project.py`) | Which provider serves each role. Roles are swappable per project. |
| `Source` (`schema/project.py`) | An immutable input the system learned from. |
| `Project` (`schema/project.py`) | Everything the system needs to test one product. |

| `ScreenEdge` (`schema/screen_graph.py`) | One candidate action the crawl tried from one screen. |
| `CrawlFrontier` (`schema/screen_graph.py`) | The BFS queue state — persisted so a crash mid-crawl leaves a resumable |

| `MappedScreen` (`schema/screenmap.py`) | One screen folded across every recording that showed it. |
| `Journey` (`schema/screenmap.py`) | One recording's ordered path through screens. |
| `ScreenMap` (`schema/screenmap.py`) | The product map: every learned screen plus the journeys that visited them. |
| `StageSpan` (`schema/trace.py`) | One finished `StageCheckpoint` (RT3) — `trace_id` is always the run's |
| `LLMSpan` (`schema/trace.py`) | One call through `Provider.see_video`/`act`/`judge` (RT4), recorded at |
| `Criterion` (`schema/verdict.py`) | One checkable bar. If it can be argued about, it is not a criterion. |
| `Rubric` (`schema/verdict.py`) | The grading contract for a case. More specific than the case itself. |
| `Failure` (`schema/verdict.py`) | One unmet criterion, with the evidence that shows it. |
| `Judgment` (`schema/verdict.py`) | Raw judge output for one grading call — the stage fills in run_id, case_id, |
| `Verdict` (`schema/verdict.py`) | The judge's output for one case in one run. |
