# AutoTester — map (generated sections; do not edit between markers)

**Purpose:** the directory map (every module's one job, from its docstring), the schema summary (every model, from its docstring), and the `scripts/` inventory (every instrument's one job, from its docstring or header comment) — derived from code by `autotester map`.
**Open me when:** you need to find which module owns a job, which model holds a shape, or which script does what (AT-520: `scripts/` used to be invisible to every routed doc). `autotester doctor` fails when this file is stale.

## Directory map
