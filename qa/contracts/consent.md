# Contract — consent gates (`RunApproval` + `require_approval`)

**Covers:** goal tasks T-124 (this gate), T-145 (the live logged-in ERP crawl it stands in front
of), T-151 (gate 1, `ApprovalKind.READ`), T-154 (gate 2 adversarial). **Owner:** /checker.
**Source of truth for intent:** plan §5A "T-124 — the two-gate consent model", authorised by
**D-018**; criteria CN1–CN7 folded verbatim from `qa/feedback-inbox.md` 2026-09-08 (maker, T-124).
**Depends on:** `core-invariants.md` (C1, C2, C3, C6) and `explore.md` (X1–X16, which the gate must
leave intact).

## Purpose

Consent used to be a habit: a `write_policy` default and a gate file a careful operator honoured.
This makes it **a file a human writes once and a runner checks every time** — what may be touched,
how much of it, until when, and who said so. The gate stands between an autonomous crawler and a
live production ERP, so it is judged adversarially: the question is never "does the code look like
it refuses", it is "can a check that ran for real get past it".

## Criteria

### CN1 — Nothing outward-facing starts without an approval, and a refused run leaves no trace
- `run_crawl` raises `ApprovalRequired` **before** a crawl envelope, a browser navigation, a click,
  a screenshot or a screenshot directory exists.
- **The property is judged at every shipped entry point, not only at the seam.** `autotester
  explore`, the UI `POST /projects/{slug}/explore`, and a direct `run_crawl` call must all leave
  the project directory exactly as they found it when the run is refused. A criterion proven only
  on a path no operator uses is the maker's own "guard tested nowhere", inverted onto the proof.
- **Verify:** `scripts/explore_proof.py`'s first invariant (real ungated crawl, assert no crawl
  directory was created) **and** a refused CLI/UI run leaving no `projects/<slug>/crawl/<id>/`.

### CN2 — The gate lives at the seam, not in each caller
- The CLI and the UI both reach `run_crawl`; neither may *replace* the seam check with its own.
- A caller-side pre-check that runs **in addition to** the seam check is permitted and is the
  expected way to satisfy CN1's second clause — the seam remains the guarantee, the pre-check is
  only there so nothing is created before the refusal.
- **Verify:** removing `_require_consent` from `run_crawl` must fail the suite and the proof
  (checker sabotage test — re-run it, do not read it).

### CN3 — An approval cannot widen itself by a careless edit
- `RunApproval.id` is content-addressed over **every** bound field (`project`, `run_kind`, `target`,
  `scope`, `max_actions`, `max_probes`, `wall_clock_s`, `production`, `granted_by`, `granted_at`,
  `expires_at`); `require_approval` refuses a row whose id no longer matches its contents.
- `note` is deliberately **outside** the payload, so a human may annotate an approval without
  re-granting it.
- **Stated limitation, not a defect to be quietly discovered later.** `content_id` is an *unkeyed*
  hash, so the id is recomputable by anyone who can write `approvals.jsonl` — including the agent
  the gate exists to bound. CN3 therefore claims exactly what it delivers: **detection of an edit
  that did not recompute the id**, i.e. accident and carelessness. It is **not** resistance to a
  forger. Any prose (docstring, CLI `--help`, commit message) that says an approval "cannot be
  edited on disk to widen itself" overclaims and must be corrected. Closing the forger case needs a
  secret outside the writable surface — an Umesh decision, tracked as **AT-110**, not assumed here.
- **Verify:** edit `max_actions` on a real `approvals.jsonl` row → refused with "edited after it was
  granted"; the recomputed-id variant is a **known, documented** acceptance until AT-110 is decided.

### CN4 — Consent is never open-ended
- `expires_at` is required. An unparseable expiry is treated as **expired**, never as eternal.
- **A bare date means the START of that day, not the end.** `expires_at: "2026-09-09"` is read by
  `fromisoformat` as midnight, so consent lapses at `2026-09-09 00:00:00`. This is recorded, not
  endorsed: whether it *should* mean end-of-day is a CRITICAL amendment (it widens every approval
  already on disk by up to 24h) and is put to the human at `qa/gates/at147-expiry-end-of-day.md`.
  Until that is answered, the semantics above are the contract.
- **The grant and the runtime must agree: every expiry `approve` ACCEPTS must be one
  `require_consent` will HONOUR.** Two comparisons implementing one rule is where AT-145 and
  AT-147 both came from — a whole day in which `approve` printed a green "granted" line for a
  consent the very next `explore` refused as expired. A refusal at the grant must also name what
  the operator should type instead; a gate that only says "no" trains the operator to stop reading
  it (the CN6 principle, applied one level up at the grant).
- **Verify:** `tests/test_consent.py`; and the property test driving the real CLI grant into the
  real `require_consent` (`tests/test_approve_cli.py::test_the_grant_and_the_runtime_agree_on_every_expiry_they_accept`).

### CN5 — Approval does not transfer
- Matching on (`project`, `run_kind`, `target`) is **EXACT** string matching. A prefix match would
  let an approval for one endpoint authorise another under the same host; consent to read is not
  consent to fire probes.
- **Trailing slash, host case and query string are deliberately different targets.** `https://h/a`
  does not authorise `https://h/a/`, `https://H/a` or `https://h/a?x=1`. This is brittle on purpose:
  the alternative is URL normalisation, and every normaliser is a place where an approval silently
  grows. The operator pastes the target out of the refusal message, which always prints the exact
  string the runner will compare, so brittleness costs a copy-paste and buys unambiguity.
- **Verify:** exactness probes over those four variants, all refused.

### CN6 — Bounds are checked, not just existence
- A run wider than its approval is refused with the shortfall named (`actions 150 > approved 20`).
- **Every** rejection reason is reported, not only the first — one bad row must not hide a good one,
  and a refusal that only says "no" teaches the operator nothing.
- **The refusal's suggested grant command must actually work.** It carries the bounds of the run it
  is refusing; an operator who pastes it verbatim (filling only the `<...>` placeholders) and re-runs
  the same command must proceed. A suggestion that does not work is worse than none, because it
  spends the reader's trust on the way to the same dead end.
- **Verify:** run the refusal's own command verbatim, then re-run the crawl; it must proceed.

### CN7 — Adversarial against production must say production
- `ApprovalKind.ADVERSARIAL` requested with `production=True` requires `production=True` granted.
- **Scope boundary (recorded so it is not mistaken for coverage):** nothing in the system computes
  *whether a target is production*, and the crawl gate never requests `production=True`. So the
  `production` field is **inert for `ApprovalKind.CRAWL`** — the live ERP crawl of T-145 is
  authorised by an ordinary crawl approval. That is the current, intended shape; making the ERP
  target require an explicit production grant is tracked as **AT-112**, not assumed to exist.
- **Verify:** `tests/test_consent.py`; a crawl-kind run must not be silently credited with CN7.

### CN8 — The done_check can fail *and* can pass
- `scripts/check_crawl_approval.py <slug>` is T-145's `done_check`. It exits 0 **only** when the
  project has a finished crawl on disk whose bounds an intact, unexpired `RunApproval` authorised;
  exit 1 otherwise; exit 2 on usage.
- A `done_check` that can only fail is no better than one that can only pass (`{"cmd": "true"}`,
  AT-100). **Both directions must be demonstrated**, on constructed state, by the checker.
- **Verify:** exit 1 today for `erp`; exit 0 against a scratch root holding a real approved crawl;
  exit 1 again when that approval is removed or tampered.

### CN9 — The gate applies to every crawl, including local fixtures
- **The maker's trade is upheld.** The gate is unconditional; it is *not* switched on by "is the
  target remote / not localhost". Tests grant a real `RunApproval` rather than bypassing the gate.
- Reasons, recorded so this is never quietly reversed: a "is this localhost?" predicate fails
  **open** on a misconfiguration (an unresolved hostname, a proxy, a tunnelled port, a stale
  `base_url`), and it is precisely the misconfigured case that most needs the refusal; and a guard
  only production callers pass through is a guard exercised by no test in the suite. The cost —
  four test entry points and the proof script granting an approval — is paid once and buys the
  gate's happy path being exercised by every crawl test that exists.
- Reversing this is a **CRITICAL** amendment (it weakens a safety invariant): human decision only.

## Out of scope / ignore (do not raise these as findings)

- **Revocation.** Expiry only, for now. There is no `autotester revoke`; deleting the row is the
  operator's lever.
- **Gate 1 (`ApprovalKind.READ`) having no caller yet** — T-151's discovery scan is its unit.
- **Gating `ingest` / `expand` / `run_case`** — T-122's live-case gate is a separate unit.
- **A UI grant form.** CLI only; the credentials page is the right home and is not built here.
- **Org-level / multi-project / wildcard approvals**, and **any auto-granting path whatsoever** —
  the absence of one is the feature.
- The `production` field being unused by the crawl gate (recorded in CN7 as a boundary, tracked as
  AT-112 — not a fresh finding each check).
- `approvals.jsonl` being deliberately hostile to hand-editing. It is a **stated exception** to
  core-invariant C6's "a human can edit any artifact": the file still loads and still deletes
  cleanly, it simply refuses an edited row instead of honouring it. C6 holds.

## Amendment log (append-only; git history is the version)

- 2026-09-08 · START · contract created by /checker from `qa/feedback-inbox.md` 2026-09-08 (maker,
  T-124), CN1–CN7 verbatim in substance · direction approved by Umesh via **D-018** and plan §5A;
  the checker authored the wording, the maker never writes a contract.
- 2026-09-08 · tighten · **CN1** extended from "`run_crawl` raises before anything exists" to "the
  property holds at every shipped entry point" · why: measured — a refused `autotester explore` and
  a refused `POST /projects/{slug}/explore` both create `projects/<slug>/crawl/<id>/shots/` and
  launch Chromium before the seam refuses, because `BrowserSession.start()` runs inside the `with`
  that wraps `run_crawl`. The narrower wording was satisfied by a path no operator uses. Tightening,
  not weakening — auto-applied. Tracked as AT-111.
- 2026-09-08 · record edge case · **CN3** limitation stated explicitly (unkeyed content-address =
  accident detection, not forgery resistance) · why: measured — a row widened 12 → 9999 actions with
  `production` flipped true and its id recomputed was accepted, and a 500-action crawl ran on a
  human grant of 12. Recording the true property rather than letting a later reader trust the
  overclaim. AT-110 carries the design decision.
- 2026-09-08 · record edge case · **CN5** trailing-slash / case / query-string variants named as
  deliberately distinct targets, with the reason · why: measured all four as refused; brittleness
  is the intended trade against a normaliser that silently widens consent.
- 2026-09-08 · tighten · **CN4** extended with (a) the measured meaning of a bare `expires_at`
  (START of the named day) and (b) the grant↔runtime agreement property · why: measured — AT-145
  and AT-147 were one defect twice, a `<` at the grant against a midnight `>` at the runtime, so
  `approve --expires <today>` was granted and then refused. Recording the property once, as a
  criterion, is what stops it arriving a third time. Tightening, not weakening — auto-applied.
  The *end-of-day alternative* is deliberately NOT adopted here: it widens every approval on disk
  by up to 24h, which is CRITICAL → `qa/gates/at147-expiry-end-of-day.md`.
- 2026-09-08 · add criterion · **CN8** (a `done_check` must be demonstrated in both directions) and
  **CN9** (the gate is unconditional; the maker's trade upheld, reversal is CRITICAL) · why: the
  maker asked for a ruling on the trade and it should not stay implicit; AT-100's lesson is that an
  unfalsifiable check is the failure mode, and "can only fail" is the mirror of it.
