# Contract — ui-run (triggering a real run from the web UI)

**Status:** ACTIVE. Amends `qa/contracts/ui.md`'s no-fire list, which previously deferred
run-triggering as "a future enhancement" (plan §3b,
`C:/Users/Lenovo/.claude/plans/great-when-you-really-iridescent-ocean.md`).

## Why this exists

Umesh: a non-technical user must be able to click a button and get a real, graded run — no
terminal. Before this, `ui/app.py` could only view state the CLI had already produced.

## Criteria

- **RU1 — real synchronous run, no second execution path.** `POST /projects/{slug}/run` calls
  the exact same `run_and_grade_case` (`stages/run_case_pipeline.py`) any CLI script would, via
  a real `BrowserSession` — never a mock, never a second copy of run/grade logic. v1 is
  synchronous (the request waits for the browser to finish) — a documented, honest boundary, not
  an oversight; no background job queue in this unit.
- **RU2 — honest failure before wasting a browser.** A project with zero cases → `400` before
  any browser starts. No AI provider configured (`LangChainFallbackProvider().available()` is
  `False`) → `400` before any browser starts. Both checked in that order.
- **RU3 — every case is run and persisted.** Every case in `store.list_cases()` gets a real
  result + verdict saved via the same `ProjectStore` methods the CLI scripts use, and a `Run`
  record is saved. The response redirects (303) to `/projects/{slug}/report` on success.
- **RU4 — global provider keys are actually visible to the running process.** A plain
  `uvicorn`/Docker process does not source `.env` on its own; `ui/app.py` must load it itself
  (matching the convention every real-run script already follows) so a key set via `.env` (or
  the future `/settings/providers` page) is genuinely usable from the web UI, not just from a
  script that happens to call `load_dotenv` itself.

## No-fire list (out of scope for this contract)

- A background job queue / async run status polling — a natural fast-follow once this
  synchronous v1 is proven, not required here.
- Report enrichment (run history, inline screenshots, download buttons) — plan §3c, a separate
  unit/contract.
- The `/settings/providers` page itself — plan §3d, a separate unit/contract (RU4 only requires
  that *if* a key is set in `.env`, the running UI process can see it).

## Amendment log (append-only; git history is the version)

- 2026-09-03 · init · contract created for the real run-trigger route unit (plan §3b, RU1-RU4),
  checker-PASSed cycle 1 (`qa/verdicts/ui-run-trigger.md`, ledger F-024).
