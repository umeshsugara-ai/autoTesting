# HUMAN_GATE — D-029 says "dev environment only"; the 2026-09-27 direction says production

**Opened:** 2026-09-28 by the maker, on `AT-654` (high, filed by the peer checker at `9bc79a31`).
**Decider:** Umesh. **Status:** OPEN — asked once, then written here.
**Blocks:** T-145 (live bounded crawl) only. **Does NOT block T-122** — see the scope finding below,
which is the part the first report of this got wrong.
**This is NOT a re-ask of the write tier.** `qa/gates/write-policy-tier.md` is closed and
`ALLOW_WRITES` stands (D-053, D-056). The axis here is **environment**, not tier, and they are
independent.

## The contradiction, verified line by line

| | Says | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **D-029** (2026-09-21) | synthetic typing into post-login forms is allowed *"on the Pathlynks **dev environment only**"*; at production targets X10's "nothing is typed" remains as it was | `docs/DECISIONS.md:460-473` |
| **The code** | when the run policy has `synthetic_typing` and the covering approval is `production`, `require_consent` raises `ApprovalRequired` — *"grant a dev-environment approval (production: false) instead"* | `stages/explore_consent.py:42-49` |
| **The schema** | `synthetic_typing` default **False**, description naming D-029's four conditions, one of which is literally **"non-production target"** | `schema/crawl.py:99-106` |
| **Umesh** (2026-09-27) | production Pathlynks is the first target, and data must actually be entered — *"डेटा एंटर करेगा नहीं तो कैसे पता चलेगा डेटा एंटर होता है नहीं होता है?"* | `qa/gates/pathlynks-user-account-first.md`, D-056 |

The guard is not incidental and not a stale implementation detail: **"non-production target" is one of
D-029's own four conditions**, so changing the behaviour means superseding a decision, not fixing a bug.

## T-145 does not "fail to run" — it runs in two modes and both are degraded

This is the precise statement, because "cannot run" invites a fix to the wrong layer:

- **`synthetic_typing` False** (the schema default) — the crawl runs against production Pathlynks and
  **types nothing**. Every surface behind a form (search results, created records, wizard steps) stays
  unreachable. That is exactly the incompleteness Umesh objected to.
- **`synthetic_typing` True** — `require_consent` raises at **preflight**, before the browser opens.
  Not a crash and not a bug: a refusal working as designed.

So no setting available today yields *"enter data on production Pathlynks."* One of the two records has
to move.

## The scope finding — T-122 is clear, and the first report implied otherwise

`grep -rn 'typing_allowed|TYPING_DISABLED' src/autotester/ --include=*.py` returns call sites in
**`explore_node.py`, `explore_replay.py`, `explore_typing.py` and `explore_safety.py` only** — every one
on the crawl path. **Nothing in the case-execution path reads that gate.** Therefore:

- **T-122** (authored login case, known test credentials, `PATHLYNKS_USER_*`) is **not governed by D-029
  at all** and is buildable today. Umesh's instruction is executable now; it does not wait on this gate.
- **T-145** (crawl, crawler-invented values) **is** governed, and is what this gate holds.

That distinction is D-029's own logic: its stated purpose was *"to stop the crawler mutating a real
product it does not understand."* **An authored case typing known test data is not a crawler inventing
values** — same keystrokes, different epistemics, and D-029's reasoning only ever covered the second.

## The options

| | Option | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Supersede D-029's environment condition** for Pathlynks under a new entry: synthetic typing permitted on production Pathlynks at `ALLOW_WRITES`, destructive-action prohibition unchanged, every typed value recorded in the run report with its prior state | Production coverage is achieved. Cost: synthetic values land in a real database with no automatic cleanup, and the report becomes the only record of what was written. Needs `Approved-by: Umesh` |
| **B** | **Point synthetic-typing crawls at `dev-new.vidysea.com`** — the PREPOD target the error message literally names — and keep production crawls typing-free | D-029 untouched. Cost: form-gated coverage is measured on prepod, so the trust number describes a different deployment than the one users use. Also needs `AT-651` fixed first, and prepod is not modelled as a project yet |
| **C** | **Split the unit:** production crawl read-only for structure and coverage, plus a separate typing pass on prepod, with the report stating which surface each number came from | Both records stay intact and nothing is hidden. Cost: two runs, two configs, and a report a reader must hold two contexts to interpret |

The maker is not choosing. D-029 is ACTIVE with a named authorization source
(`qa/gates/post-login-forms.md` option b, Umesh 2026-09-21), and option A supersedes it — under the Lab
Protocol that needs Umesh's entry, not a builder's judgement. **The guard is also not routed around:**
no unit sets `production: false` on a production approval to get past it.
