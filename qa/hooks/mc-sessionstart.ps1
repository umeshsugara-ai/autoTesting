  # (`**Date:** ... - **Cycle checked:** 1 - **Commit:** ...`), and some write
  # `**Cycle checked: 1**` with the colon INSIDE the bold. A `^`-anchored read silently
  # skipped all 45 and scored them -1, the same silent-skip class as the Status field.
  # A fully unanchored read is not the answer either: sweep-2026-09-24.md quotes
  # `Cycle checked: 1` inside a code span while describing a DIFFERENT file, and that
  # would be read as this file's value. So the field must BEGIN at line start or just
  # after a separator -- a backtick is neither, which is what excludes the quote. An
  # inline-code strip was tried here first and removed: measured over all 543 manifests
  # and verdicts it changed zero answers, because the boundary already covers the case.
  # LAST field wins (LS6).
  # AT-713 (cycle 2, authorized by D-056): take the MAXIMUM, not the last.
  # LS6 is a rule about MANIFESTS -- they append new cycles BELOW, so last-wins is
  # right there. Verdicts order history the OPPOSITE way, newest on top. Measured
  # over all 280 verdicts: 40 carry more than one cycle value, 39 ascend and exactly
  # one descends -- and that one read 1 when it is 2. Cycle numbers only ever
  # increase, so MAX is correct under BOTH orderings while last-wins is correct
  # under only one.
  #
  # AT-714 (same waiver): the boundary no longer admits a BARE SPACE. It used to,
  # via the \s inside the character class, so ordinary prose counted -- measured on
  # disk, 24 hits sit after a plain word ("manifest Fix cycle: 1 of 3",
  # "manifest's Fix cycle: 1 of 3"), describing ANOTHER file's value. Harmless under
  # last-wins if they happened to agree; actively harmful under MAX, which is why
  # both rows had to land in the same cycle.
  #
  # The boundary is now: line start, or a character that is neither a word character
  # nor whitespace nor a backtick, followed by optional whitespace. Measured over all
  # 546 manifests and verdicts, that admits every real separator (`·` 66, `,` 41,
  # `#` heading 9, `-` 6, `.` 4) and the 533 at line start, while excluding the 23
  # quoted inside a code span and the 24 after a bare word. Written as a negated class
  # rather than a literal separator list so the file stays pure ASCII.
  # The inline-code strip is BACK, and this time it is load-bearing. Cycle 1 removed
  # it after measuring that it changed 0 answers, which was correct THEN: under the
  # old boundary a backtick immediately before the field already excluded the quote.
  # It does not survive MAX. A QUOTED HEADING -- `## Cycle checked: 2` written inside
  # a code span while describing another file -- puts a `#` between the backtick and
  # the field, and `#` is itself a legal separator, so the quote is re-admitted
  # through the heading allowance. Found by running the hook on this unit's own
  # verdict (`:96`), which reported an unclosed PASS that does not exist. Measured
  # over all 546 manifests and verdicts, the strip changes exactly ONE answer -- that
  # file, 2 -> 1 -- so it is narrow and it is necessary.
