# AT-113 — abandoned exploration cannot claim completion

## Status: STALLED

Fix cycle: 3
Current cycle outcome: independent headed X4 FAIL on frozen 085537cd549a6aa0ce522aee3d9a6486f2874c83; max-cycle recovery disposition required. See qa/verdicts/at113-crawl-completion.md and qa/debug/at113-crawl-completion-cycle3.md. No release or full T-165 closure.
Criticality: CRITICAL
Dual check: required
Goal: T-165 (reopened); blocks truthful T-145 acceptance.
Branch: codex/at113-crawl-completion
Worktree: D:/autoTesting/.worktrees/at113-crawl-completion

## Cycle 3 full-suite failure inventory (attribution, not waiver)

Frozen source: 085537cd549a6aa0ce522aee3d9a6486f2874c83. Checker B's full-cycle3.xml records 24 failed / 2223 passed; maker re-read all 24 failed testcase identities from that XML on 2026-10-01. Independent baseline evidence under .work/check-at113-c3-b-085537/: baseline-metadata-hooks.xml/.log reproduces IDs 1-12; baseline-mutation-ids.xml/.log reproduces IDs 13-22; baseline-timeouts.xml/.log reproduces IDs 23-24. baseline-rootdir.xml/.log separately demonstrates the nested pytest-root cause for IDs 13-22. These remain failures, not a green suite or blanket waiver. Current X4 product FAIL is separate and unchanged. Implicated baseline-to-source paths were independently reported unchanged by checker B; maker does not certify another checker's verdict.

## Plan and independent approval

Concrete plan: .work/at113-completion-plan.md.
Fresh independent approval: qa/verdicts/at113-completion-plan-review.md, APPROVE revised rules.
Original issue retained: AT-113, reopened; no duplicate issue or renamed defect.
Independent reproduction: qa/verdicts/sweep-2026-09-30-crawl-recovery.md.

## What changed (implemented on the pinned private checkpoint)

- src/autotester/stages/explore_status.py::terminal_status, displayed_status, is_success.
- src/autotester/stages/explore.py::_bfs.
- src/autotester/stages/persona_changes.py::_judged_exhausted, describe.
- src/autotester/cli_crawl.py::echo_crawl_summary;
  src/autotester/stages/crawl_report.py::crawl_summary;
  src/autotester/ui/crawl_view.py::summary_stats;
  src/autotester/ui/routes_crawls.py::crawls: shared legacy display-only reason, preserving escaping
  and stored artifacts. Fresh independent reviewer approved this amendment after tracing all four.
- Existing tests/test_explore_node_recovery.py, tests/test_crawl_status_surfaces.py,
  tests/test_explore_completeness.py, tests/test_persona_changes.py; edit in place, no new module.
- Existing tests/test_explore_blocked.py: terminal status controls and both aborted node kinds.
- docs/SNAPSHOT.md: regenerated by the existing snapshot generator; no handwritten architecture
  or contract edit. The scoped branch checkpoint includes exactly these seven source files,
  five test files and this generated snapshot (13 paths); runtime/credential/QA artifacts excluded.

## Acceptance and capabilities

CR5/C12: actual aborted-error/dialog visits do not report completed/exhausted; siblings continue.
X4/X18: preserve actual named bounds, login precedence and policy controls.
CR4/CR5: unreached stored screens remain missing_unjudged after aborted exploration, even with
optimistic caller exhaustion. Healthy static completion and genuine missing remain possible.
X16: legacy specific coverage error evidence renders non-success across UI, CLI and workbook;
absent evidence, zero actions alone, issue counts and low percentages do not fabricate abort.
Legacy error evidence means an unperformed control, not necessarily a whole abandoned node.

Required before ready-for-check: failing-first tests; green affected suite; unpiped full pytest,
ruff and doctor; headed fixture/report proof; named single-hunk mutation guard kills with green
baseline/actual patch/attributable failure/restore green; fresh senior review; unit branch commit.
Dual independent checkers must review the exact SHA and matching cycle before master merge/push.

## Latest authoritative summary — 2026-09-30

### Final handoff (supersedes all process-status snapshots below)

Cycle 2 submission: f9052150f4cd2af19a5ed3888173e910fa1220ed.
Executed approved git commit --amend --only --no-edit -- with exactly
src/autotester/stages/explore_status.py and tests/test_explore_blocked.py.
Old SHA retained at codex/at113-cycle1-preserved. Both complete tree hashes
are 2c96e96237bdcc4a7c05ed23c95136581bdaa9d0; git diff oldSHA HEAD exits 0;
parent remains d219f03add5df490b9fa068b03f9037016526295. Tracked tree clean.
Cycle 1 FAIL committed ec756fc4 and remains historical below. No behavioral
change, waiver, merge or push. All prior measured outputs are old-SHA evidence;
cycle 2 requires fresh exact-SHA gates and dual independent checkers.

Cycle 2 verification in progress (not verdict): primary owns full-suite session
15904. Independent read-only escalated CIM confirms pytest PID19096/parent41280
alive; newer test temp directory test_every_route_a_depth_bound0 at 22:48:17
proves progress beyond inventory despite unchanged buffered 15% output. No restart
or process termination. Secondary independently measured ruff clean, archived
source doctor with only T-171 ledger violation, 25 pure oracle assertions and
3 asserted-anchor/hash/restore mutation kills. Both own headed instruments are
prepared but not launched while primary heavy lane is live. Neither these partial
results nor instrument readiness constitutes final C7/Mode D or dual PASS.

Cycle 1 primary checker verdict is FAIL at qa/verdicts/at113-crawl-completion.md:
C10 mandatory explicit-path commit command violated by the disclosed bare commit.
Behavioral criteria, C7 and Mode D are explicitly NOT ASSESSED in that verdict.
No heavy checker jobs were launched. Second fresh checker dispatch twice failed
with agent-thread-limit; no second verdict or dual PASS exists.

Independent read-only recovery review (/root/approve_at113_merge_resolution)
APPROVE: after primary verdict commit and reviewer termination, preserve old
3342f89a with a private ref, recreate ONLY tip via
git commit --amend --only --no-edit -- src/autotester/stages/explore_status.py tests/test_explore_blocked.py.
Verify identical full tree and unchanged d219f03a parent; stop on mismatch.
Then increment cycle to 2 and pin new SHA for fresh independent checks.
This changes no behavior and does not invalidate/hide cycle 1 FAIL; prior
test/runtime outputs remain historical, not new-SHA verification.

Current submission SHA: f9052150f4cd2af19a5ed3888173e910fa1220ed.
Primary cycle-2 PASS now committed fb83b76b387b1d611ff64158db08ed78346ccbd1;
maker read the actual verdict file: exact submitted SHA, 8/8 diff-scoped
adjudications, 17/17 independently killed mutations, baseline/restored72 green,
complete byte-identical source hashes, seven own headed scenarios and explicit
C7 exceptions. Only the verdict path committed; index/lane released. Secondary
has no final verdict and remains blind; own full-suite55836 live28% last verified.
Manifest remains ready-for-check, AT-113 issue OPEN, whole T-165/T-145 pending.
No dual PASS, merge or push. Prior IN PROGRESS snapshots below are historical.
Latest independent runtime: primary handle69518 terminal exit0, seven own-headed
scenarios (three actual Explore crawls and four legacy controls), history/detail
and workbook assertions; attributed blocked-font/download events, no pageerrors.
Owned browser/server cleanup and port54993/54991 readback confirmed closed.
Prior instrument failures are retained, not product failures. Exact hidden+tall
scroll baseline c559 test passed1/1; the new full-suite failure is NOT baseline
reproduced and remains unresolved pending setup/page.goto trace attribution.
Heavy lane released to secondary for its own unpiped full suite; primary continues
own nonbrowser mutation/baseline checks. No final verdict or waiver recorded here.

Individually named new cycle-2 failure:
tests/test_browser_scroll_invariance.py::test_what_is_reported_does_not_change_when_anything_is_scrolled[hidden+tall].
Full trace in root .work/check-at113-a-full.txt shows fixture page.goto failing
with net::ERR_NO_BUFFER_SPACE at http://127.0.0.1:49906 BEFORE observe/assertions.
Primary's suite-created native debug.log records Windows socket connect error
10055; it was preserved reversibly under .work before doctor rerun. Independent
c559 exact-node run passed1/1, so this is NOT a baseline-reproduced test failure.
Primary's read-only diff comparison reports its fixture/browser paths unchanged
outside this unit's thirteen-path diff. Measured evidence supports setup/resource
failure rather than a changed scroll assertion, but final checker independently
adjudicates C7 cause/scope; no waiver or behavioral PASS is written by maker.
Doctor after preserving owned generated log has only T-171 missing ledger row,
independently present on baseline. Source behavior/SHA remain unchanged.
Primary cycle-2 full suite is now TERMINAL exit 1: 15 failed, 2221 passed,
6 skipped, 14 xfailed, 15 warnings in 1586.20s. Actual log is root
.work/check-at113-a-full.txt. New scroll-invariance hidden+tall failure
differs from the earlier maker failure set; individual attribution pending,
not waived. Primary is cleaning only verified owned residual mutation-test
trees before own headed Mode D. Secondary fresh byte-exact 13-mutation
proof is terminal with baseline/restored green and 1765-file identity;
secondary full-suite and actual Mode D remain pending. No dual verdict yet.
Prior measured source SHA: 3342f89afe4769b7de6dbb88b05661602bd64acf.
Comparison baseline: c5596a0a. Tracked src/tests are clean; 13 changed paths.
No implementation PASS, master merge or public push has occurred.

Full pytest is TERMINAL exit 1: 15 failed, 2222 passed, 5 skipped,
14 xfailed, 15 warnings in 1602.91s. Complete isolated-worktree log:
.work/at113-3342-full-pytest.txt. It is not a green gate.
The twelve hook/mutation-timeout IDs and missing-approval serial HTTP 403
listed below remain failures. Two additional failures are goal registration
(81 progress total versus 82 tasks) and done-check missing T-171's named
tests/test_permission_surface.py. A fresh independent clean git archive of
c5596a0a at root .work/at113-c559-two-archive reproduced both failures
(2 failed in 0.21s); the goal and both test blobs are identical at baseline
and unit SHA, outside this unit diff. Inventory now passes in the full run.
Final checkers must independently derive C7 attribution; none is waived here.

Actual uv ruff gate exits 0, All checks passed. Actual uv doctor exits 1,
one ledger-row-missing:T-171 violation, independently reproduced on upstream.
The ledger reason confirmation remains pending as recorded below; do not
fabricate acceptance or weaken doctor. Installed shared venv runs use uv
--active --no-sync with isolated PYTHONPATH and local cache because dependency
downloads are unavailable. Pytest equivalent uses that installed Python,
-o pythonpath=src, unique basetemp/cache and no extra -q.

Final maker mutation proof: 17/17 assertion kills, 72 baseline/restored passes,
byte-identical source identity, exact SHA, 20 full logs and import/hash records:
worktree qa/evidence/at113-crawl-completion/final/checkpoint17.
Capabilities independently falsified by the maker harness: terminal abort;
actual-bound precedence; login precedence; abandonment/frontier exhaustion;
frontier cause; sibling retention; persona deletion and incomplete wording;
legacy evidence predicate; display status/reason; false empty-frontier reason;
CLI, workbook, detail and history call sites; deferred drain ordering; failed
login observation qualifier. This is evidence, not checker certification.

Independent headed browser evidence: root .work/at113-independent-browser/
report.json, runtime-summary.md, owned-cleanup.json. Eight scenarios exercised
history/detail and actual Excel downloads. All eight workbooks reopened;
legacy stored bytes stayed unchanged. Actual repeated dialog abandonment left
the independent sibling explored. Login qualifier uses disclosed scoped fault
injection, not real authentication. 54 console errors are specifically denied
Google Fonts CSS URLs; zero pageerrors. Eight report request ERR_ABORTED events
correspond to successful 200 downloads with readable bytes. Fresh independent
runtime-attribution review APPROVE verified each event's own exact font URL,
unchanged upstream theme_style.py, workbook bytes, manifests and cleanup.
Limitations: disk import hashes are not loaded-bytecode/child module proof;
the probe has no failed-request allowlist or synthetic negative font test.
No owned PID 43024 or listener 8993 remained after runtime cleanup.

Required checker work: full protocol and applicable contracts, exact-SHA own
gates, independent capability falsification and own Mode D browser script.
Neither checker may read maker/browser probe scripts, screenshots or the other
checker verdict. Sequential heavy lanes avoid resource interference.
PASS of AT-113 must NOT close full T-165: generic recovery, actual Pathlynks
E2E, eval compilation, release regression and full goal acceptance remain open.
The C10 bare-commit procedure deviation below remains disclosed for adjudication.

### Historical measured snapshots (not current process state)

Final current-SHA maker mutation proof completed: checkpoint17 runner exit 0,
17/17 named assertion kills, baseline 72 passed (26.29s), restored 72 passed (26.34s),
one external warning each. Root independently asserted every expected failure set
is contained in the actual failed IDs and start/end identity files are byte-equal,
pinned 3342f89afe4769b7de6dbb88b05661602bd64acf. No timeout/survivor/collection kill.
Ordering and qualifier mutations each fail all four named new cases. Full outputs,
17 anchor/changed-byte proofs and 20 per-run import/hash records are under worktree
qa/evidence/at113-crawl-completion/final/checkpoint17. This is maker evidence,
not independent checker PASS. Fresh full-suite handle 33640 remains live.

Fresh integrated review found abandonment early return bypassed X18(a)'s failed-login
observation qualifier. Same-cycle repair independently approved; four new cases first
failed on the missing qualifier, then existing terminal_status was repaired in place.
Latest affected run: 83 passed, 1 warning in 43.84s, exit 0; ruff All checks passed.
New deferred-order four cases are implemented and green. Source/test amendment committed
privately as 3342f89afe4769b7de6dbb88b05661602bd64acf after fresh senior APPROVE:
independent 57 passed in 25.06s covering login/bound/status precedence, focused ruff clean.
terminal_status 42 lines, source 256, test 206. Final-SHA 17-mutation run completed
as recorded above. Earlier 15 kills remain historical, not current-SHA evidence.

Actual fresh full-suite handle 33640 launched on pinned 3342f89a with explicit
pythonpath=src and unique temp/cache, complete unpiped log
.work/at113-3342-full-pytest.txt. Mutation worker handle 24894 is now terminal exit0;
its complete result and identity binding are recorded above. Full-suite result pending.
ScheduleWakeup is unavailable in the enabled tool inventory; no armed-loop claim is made.

Continuation verified same full-suite handle 33640 live; tracked src/tests remain clean
at exact 3342f89a. Mutation worker re-polled same 24894: baseline 72 passed, 1 warning
in 26.29s, first six perturbations exercised; no final kill count claimed yet. Login-bound
mutation failed the named False/True precedence tests, not import/collection.
Read-only full-traversal audit separately identified seed-restoration fingerprint drift
as the next recovery gap; initial evidence is the existing Pathlynks 1 explored/4 aborted/
16 queued crawl and repeated no-edge-for-seed restoration failures. Exact seam/acceptance
audit pending; no Pathlynks-specific source workaround or additional unit implemented.

Read-only next-gap audit completed: exact existing seams and six bounded-recovery
acceptance checks are recorded in .work/at113-completion-plan.md final section.
Scope stays separate until current AT-113 unit passes. Same full-suite 33640 was
re-polled live; log progressed one further assertion marker, not terminal. Available
physical RAM measured through Windows GlobalMemoryStatusEx: 3091 MB (read-only,
no memory-floor override or unrelated process cleanup). Mutation same24894 progressed
through mutation11; all observed deliberate runs exit1 but final attribution still pending.

Checkpoint procedure disclosure: 3342f89a used staged two-path index audit followed
by bare git commit on the isolated branch, rather than C10's required --only pathspec.
git show and tracked-clean readback confirm the commit contains exactly terminal_status
source and existing blocked-test file, no foreign paths. This does not excuse the command
discipline deviation; final checker must assess it. Do not rewrite the checkpoint during
the running exact-SHA checks. All subsequent commits must use explicit --only paths.

Doctor currently fails one ledger-row-missing T-171 violation. Independent read-only
diagnostic reproduced exactly the same violation on master c5596a0a and isolated d219f03:
upstream high-value checker-PASS close-out omitted FEATURES.jsonl entry. No doctor weakening
or invented ledger row. Required prefilled reason shown to Umesh for confirm-or-edit;
this bookkeeping gate does not stop remaining AT-113 verification. No completion PASS/push.

Prefilled T-171 ledger reason shown once for confirm-or-edit (answer pending):
"Make permission-limited coverage explicit and preserve crawl-global destructive-last
ordering so an incomplete portal crawl cannot look fully tested."
Do not ask again or fabricate an answer. Existing ledger CLI is the required append path.

Independent browser preparation dispatched to /root/prepare_at113_independent_browser,
contract + exact3342 source only, blind to maker scripts/evidence/verdicts. It prepares
its own scratch probe; no Chromium/server launch while full-suite33640 owns the browser
lane. No unit verdict requested while manifest is building.

Independent preparation now ready at .work/at113-independent-browser/probe.py:
exact3342 AST/import readiness passed; actual runtime not executed. Own signed-local
fixture approvals and sandbox; future UI8993 + ephemeral fixture. Scenarios include
Explore form, healthy static crawl, action bound, real repeated-dialog abandoned child
with surviving sibling, history/detail/Excel clicks, persisted legacy bytes unchanged,
and login qualifier under disclosed scoped observation-fault injection. Fresh read-only
probe review dispatched before any runtime; no maker script/evidence reused.

Fresh probe review WARNING: HEAD-only binding must also reject dirty executed source;
owned server timeout must not skip fixture/log cleanup; favicon-only readiness needs
instance ownership proof. Independent verifier assigned repairs in its existing scratch
script plus cheap discriminating safety checks. No product source change or browser
execution; readiness is not accepted until this warning is resolved independently.

The paragraphs below retain prior measured snapshots; the latest amendment evidence above
supersedes their pending-test/review descriptions, not their historical measurements.

Private checkpoint 20b27ff1 committed exactly the 13 named paths. Independently approved
merge of pinned c5596a0a completed as d219f03add5df490b9fa068b03f9037016526295; two
conflicts resolved only in _bfs (deferred drain before abandonment judging) and generated
snapshot. Final diff versus c5596a0a remains 13 paths. Master and remote were not changed.
Fresh post-integration source review dispatched. Additional existing-file deferred-order
checks/ordering mutation independently approved and are pending implementation. All
pre-integration test/browser/mutation outputs below are not exact integrated-SHA proof.

Final affected suite: 79 passed, 1 warning in 235.50s (exit 0), isolated worktree
.work/at113-resumed-green.txt. Ruff: All checks passed (exit 0). Doctor: clean (exit 0),
.work/at113-resumed-doctor2.txt; existing snapshot generator used and generated debug.log
recoverably relocated to .work/debug-at113-resumed-preserved.log.

Headed maker smoke: qa/evidence/browser-at113-crawl-completion-2026-09-30/report.json now
records five pages, zero console errors per page and seven successful interactions,
including history/detail/actual Excel download and unchanged stored legacy bytes. It preserves
healthy completed/green, bounded max_actions/non-green, partial aborted/both causes/non-green.
This is smoke only: each checker must write and run its own headed interaction instrument.

Full-suite run is NOT green: 14 failed, 2189 passed, 5 skipped, 14 xfailed. Attribution:
the following exact failures independently reproduced on untouched bc25ad17 (12 failed,
6 passed, 1 skipped, exit 1); causes outside this diff are execution-policy/missing hook
signals and surviving subprocess trees. Logs: root .work/at113-base-triage/.work-triage-result2.txt.

tests/test_crawl_inventory_live.py::test_a_logged_in_crawl_maps_every_route_and_names_the_one_it_refused:
full-suite hit wall_clock_s; exact isolated test passed on base (223.60s) and unit (225.09s)
with the unchanged 240s bound. Cause timing/resource-associated, no regression observed in
isolation; NOT a full-suite PASS or unconditional waiver. Unit .work/triage-unit-inventory.txt
and root .work/at113-base-triage/.work-triage-inventory.txt. Checker must re-derive C7 attribution.

Only identified baseline-owned orphan trees 42176/11208 were terminated; exact PID readback
confirmed absent. No unrelated process was touched. All old process-status notes below are
historical, not claims that jobs remain live.

Final mutation artifact: 15/15 named kills, baseline 64 passed, restored 64 passed, no timeout.
Current anchors all match exactly once, but historical whole-file hash snapshot is missing.
Final integrated-SHA mutation evidence remains required. Fresh senior source review approved
the amended wording (independent 24 passed); current-master integration plan independently
APPROVED at qa/verdicts/at113-completion-plan-review.md. Pinned upstream c5596a0a must retain
drain_deferred before exhaustion judging and permitted coverage denominators/reasons.

Next: private scoped branch checkpoint, integrate pinned master, resolve no semantic conflict
without fresh approval, rerun exact-SHA gates/mutations, independent Mode D and dual checks.
No master merge/push, implementation PASS or full T-165/whole-goal close-out is authorized yet.

## Historical measured evidence (superseded process states)

### Resumption readback — 2026-09-30

Old maker/reviewer agents were no longer active; no running-job claim is retained from
their earlier messages. Current isolated worktree still has the seven source and five
test edits, uncommitted. Fresh evidence worker and read-only failure-triage agent dispatched.

Actual full-suite log ended: 14 failed, 2189 passed, 5 skipped, 14 xfailed, 15 warnings
in 4031.84s (1:07:11). This is NOT a green gate. Exact failure causes/base comparison
remain pending; environment or pre-existing status is not assumed.

Headed fixture report persisted healthy=completed/frontier empty, bounded=stopped_bound/
max_actions, partial=aborted with both aborted_error/settings and aborted_dialog/dialog,
while students/reports siblings were explored. Its pages and interactions arrays remain
empty: rendered report interaction/console proof is incomplete, not a browser UI PASS.

Current next actions: final snapshot affected tests, attributed mutation/readback evidence,
full-failure diagnosis/base reproduction, complete existing headed report instrument,
then exact-commit dual independent checks. No implementation PASS, commit or push yet.

Resumed evidence readback: final mutation-results.json contains 15/15 killed, zero
timeouts/survivors. Final mutation-run-01 collected 64 tests; run-02 baseline has
64 passed in 8.01s; run-18 restoration has 64 passed in 13.31s. Worker inspected
single-anchor/changed-content harness assertions. Exact final source/hash binding and
independent checker re-derivation still required; these are not a completion verdict.

Fresh resumed worker launched headed browser session 87286, affected suite 78602,
doctor 29667; ruff exited 0 (All checks passed). Read-only triage launched untouched
bc25ad17 baseline subset session 85074. These are actual reported handles, not results.

Untouched bc25ad17 baseline subset finished exit 1: 12 failed, 6 passed, 1 skipped
in 109.18s. Readback confirms the exact same ten hook and two mutation-timeout FAIL
IDs as the unit full-suite log. Baseline log: .work/at113-base-triage/
.work-triage-result2.txt under the root project. Inventory baseline session 93512
is still live. Serial-run baseline probe skipped (734 MB free below its 3584 MB RAM
floor); this does NOT prove its full-suite 403 pre-existing. Two failures unresolved.

Final mutation guards match current source exactly once, but no historical source-hash
snapshot was captured before mechanical CLI cap trimming. Do not claim whole-file
hash identity from those artifacts. Exact current/reviewed-commit evidence remains a gate.

Implementation now exists on the isolated branch: seven existing source modules and five
existing test modules. Maker measured final affected suite: 72 passed, 1 external Starlette
deprecation warning in 46.19s; worktree .work/at113-final-green.txt. This is maker evidence,
not an independent completion verdict. Fresh senior review dispatched; full gates, mutation
proof, headed browser smoke and exact-SHA dual checks remain pending.

Contract question for independent checkers: persona_changes.describe now says
"not judged (the crawl was incomplete)" because its diff input contains no exact stop cause.
The independently approved plan permits this accurate generic wording, but CR4 previously
names bound/skipped-unchanged causes. Please adjudicate the actual contract requirement;
the maker has not modified contracts or weakened acceptance to obtain PASS.

CR4 question resolved at plan level: fresh senior reviewer explicitly approved preserving
the named alternative causes: "not judged (a bound, skipped-unchanged screen, or abandoned
visit left the crawl incomplete)". Approval recorded in the existing plan-review artifact.
Source amendment read back by orchestrator and reviewer. Reviewer then found the existing
test assertion still expected generic wording at line 213 despite the maker's report;
assertion repair/readback and final-snapshot checks remain pending. Source-plus-test
application and snapshot stability are not proven by the maker message alone.

Subsequent independent readback resolved that mismatch: fresh senior reviewer confirmed
source line 199 and existing test assertion line 213 both contain the approved wording.
Its independent final persona rerun exited 0: 24 passed in 9.83s. Senior source-review
VERDICT: Approve, no remaining >80%-confidence findings; not implementation PASS or merge
authorization. The full five-file run (79 passed) predates the wording change; the 24-case
persona rerun verifies the amendment separately. Full gates, mutations, final rendered
report and dual exact-SHA checker verdicts remain release requirements.

Independent senior focused rerun (five test files) exited 0: 79 passed, 1 warning in
548.10s (0:09:08), including seven existing real-browser completeness cases. That process
began before the wording amendment; it is not final-wording verification. The reviewer is
rerunning persona tests against the amended snapshot. No completion PASS is implied.

Independent actual local run_crawl: completed, frontier empty, zero actions, one aborted_error,
success=true, issues=1. Actual Pathlynks first crawl corroborates. Existing targeted baseline:
32 passed, 1 warning; original sandbox-temp attempt had 9 setup permission errors, not product
assertion failures. Baseline rerun used scoped local temp/cache and exited 0.

No implementation PASS, no release claim. Generic authenticated restoration, permission-surface
coverage, full Pathlynks acceptance and whole-goal regression acceptance remain separate work.
### Pre-integration ancestry/path inspection (not release acceptance)

2026-09-30 live read-only inspection: `git merge-base --is-ancestor c5596a0a HEAD` and the same command for immutable f9052150 both exited 0. `git diff --name-only c5596a0a HEAD` lists only the two checker-owned verdict files; c5596a0a..f9052150 lists the 13 submitted source/test/generated-snapshot paths. These committed path sets do not overlap. Private worktree `git diff --stat` is empty. Root dirty user/goal/QA/Pathlynks files remain preserved; index changes are not swept. This establishes a clean committed ancestry/path basis for later integration, not dual PASS, a successful merge, push, or live browser validation. Second checker terminal attribution and own Mode D remain pending.
### Cycle-2 secondary decisive runtime finding; release held

Secondary checker independently confirmed all1765 archived tracked source bytes equal f905. Its actual positive-valid max_depth=1 runtime, with descendants at depth2, returned COMPLETED/frontier empty and3nodes; independent c559 baseline reproduced this behavior. X4 is explicitly applicable to this unit and requires the fired bound to end/name the crawl: pre-existing behavior does not satisfy that criterion. Secondary has been asked to persist its own final FAIL with exact commands/observations. Primary PASS does not override it; no dual PASS, issue closure, master integration or push is authorized. Fresh read-only cycle3 repair-plan review dispatched to settle existing _enqueue/stop_reason propagation, actual red-first depth behavior, budgets and ordering. Next seed-recovery implementation remains separate and unstarted.
### Current cycle3 authoritative state

Cycle2 secondary FAIL is persisted at03c59e100a981c4a5b089af47f4e711592009d3a; primary cycle2 PASS cannot close this unit. Current approved two-function depth repair is uncommitted in the isolated private worktree: unseen depth refusal records a named bound, shared bound checker retains recorded names. Historical f905 references below describe cycle2, not current submitted code. No cycle3 SHA submitted yet.

Red run35520:3 failed/2 controls passed on unchanged source, covering false completion and sticky reason overwrite. Corrected policy fixture retains default destructive patterns under ALLOW_WRITES; acceptance assertions unchanged. Expanded focused run:11 passed/29 deselected.
