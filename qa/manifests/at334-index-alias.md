# Manifest — at334-index-alias

**Unit:** A directory index reached two ways (`/` and `/index.html`) must be one screen identity,
not two — `core.urls.url_template` kept the path as served, so `/` and `/index.html` produced
different `(url_template, signature)` node ids.
**Contract:** no `qa/contracts/` criterion number names this directly; judged against X15
(`qa/contracts/explore.md` — `Screen.url_pattern` / `ScreenNode.url_template` must reduce to one
identity) and `qa/contracts/ingest.md`'s "url_template is the ONE place a URL is normalised"
invariant. Flagged for the checker to decide whether a dedicated criterion is warranted.
**Date:** 2026-09-26
**Fix cycle:** 2 of 3
**Dual check:** no
**Persona walk:** skip (pure identity-normalisation fix, no persona/UI surface touched)
**Issues addressed:** AT-334, AT-618
**Executor:** claude-opus-subagent

## The gap (AT-334, as filed)

Measured on a real browser crawl of `tests/fixtures/modal_site`: six nodes for a three-page site.
`NODE a80f79 /` and `NODE 49083d /index.html` were the SAME page in the same veiled state
(identical reachable controls), and likewise for the dismissed-veil pair — but `core/urls.py::
url_template` kept the path as served, so the two forms produced different node ids. Both pairs
also filed their own OVERLAY issue for the same veil, so the duplication inflated screen counts,
coverage percentages, the bench scorecard, and a `max_screens`-bounded crawl's budget.

## What changed

- `src/autotester/core/urls.py::url_template` (`:83`) — new keyword-only parameter
  `fold_index: bool = False`. When `True`, a trailing `index.html`/`index.htm` PATH SEGMENT is
  dropped from `segments` *before* templating, so `/index.html` -> `/` and `/docs/index.html` ->
  `/docs` (matching whatever `/docs/` itself already normalises to under the pre-existing
  trailing-slash-drop rule — **not** `/docs/`, which would be a third, never-otherwise-produced
  shape and would break the function's own documented idempotence). The match is exact and
  case-sensitive: `myindex.html`, `index.html.bak`, `index.php` and `/Index.html` are all
  untouched. New module constant `_INDEX_SEGMENTS = {"index.html", "index.htm"}` (`:23`).
- **Default is `False`, not `True` — a mid-build discovery, not the original design.** Building
  this the way the brief first described (fold unconditionally inside `url_template`) broke two
  currently-passing tests in `tests/test_migrate_url_patterns.py`:
  `test_a_pattern_carrying_a_port_matches_a_host_declared_without_one` and
  `test_a_pattern_without_a_port_matches_a_host_declared_with_one`, both of which pin
  `repair("/127.0.0.1:46661/index.html", ...)` == `"/index.html"` (never `/`).
  `scripts/migrate_url_patterns.py::repair` (`:90`) calls `url_template` directly on the path
  remaining after it strips a project-declared host, and that script sits behind its own separate,
  unanswered gate (`qa/gates/t135-url-pattern-data-migration.md`) — the brief explicitly forbids
  touching it or its behaviour. Making the fold opt-in resolves this with **zero changes** to
  `scripts/migrate_url_patterns.py`: every caller that never asks for `fold_index=True` (including
  `repair`) keeps behaving exactly as it did before this unit.
- `src/autotester/core/urls.py::screen_url_pattern` (`:170`) — now calls
  `url_template(absolute_url(raw), keep_host=False, fold_index=True)`. This is the X15 boundary
  (`Screen.url_pattern`, used by `stages/ingest.py`, `stages/product_map.py`, and
  `stages/explore_status.py::login_template`) that must agree with `ScreenNode.url_template` for
  coverage to compare a video-taught screen against a crawl-observed one at all — both now fold.
- `src/autotester/stages/screen_identity.py::node_from` (`:64`) — now calls
  `url_template(observation.url, keep_host=False, fold_index=True)`, the actual site of the filed
  bug (`ScreenNode.id` is a hash of `(url_template, signature)` — `schema/screen_graph.py:79-82`).
- `tests/test_urls.py` — 15 tests added: the fold itself (root, nested-directory, `.htm`,
  query/fragment survival, host-kept forms), the `fold_index` default-off safety net tied directly
  to the discovered `migrate_url_patterns` conflict, four non-fold pins (`myindex.html`,
  `index.html.bak`, `index.php`, case-sensitivity) run *with* `fold_index=True` so the guard is
  proven under the condition where it actually matters, and `screen_url_pattern`'s own fold.
- `tests/test_screen_identity.py` — 1 test added,
  `test_index_html_and_directory_root_collapse_to_one_node_identity`, reproducing the exact AT-334
  measurement (identical controls at `/` and `/index.html`) at the `node_from` boundary — pure,
  no browser.
- No `docs/MAP.md` regeneration needed — no new module, `autotester doctor`'s generated-doc
  freshness check passed clean (see below).

**RAM-gated deviation from the literal verify command (disclosed):** `uv run pytest tests/ -k "url
or explore or crawl"` as specified collects ~380 tests, including 7 files that drive a real
headless Chromium (`test_browser*.py`, `test_crawl_inventory_live.py`, `test_explore_live.py`,
`test_explore_login_spa_live.py`) plus `test_explore_modal.py`. Both the literal command and a
version with the seven live-browser files excluded were run and each hit a 100-120s timeout with
zero output in this sandboxed environment before being terminated — consistent with the brief's
own repeated "RAM is tight" warning. Ran instead: the exact two commands shown above, covering
every non-browser file whose name matches `url`/`explore`/`crawl` plus `test_ingest_persist.py`
(the other X15 producer) and `test_migrate_url_patterns.py` (the file this unit's own fold-safety
decision is about). `test_explore_modal.py` (the one file that would exercise the actual
`tests/fixtures/modal_site` fixture named in AT-334, live) was attempted once and also timed out
at 100s with no output — not retried a second time per the "at most once or twice" instruction.
Live-crawl confirmation against that fixture is left to the checker's Mode D, as the brief
permits.

## Capability coverage (each claim -> its isolating falsification)

Falsified in a throwaway copy OUTSIDE the tracked worktree, using plain stdlib `importlib`
(`core/urls.py` has zero third-party dependencies, so no `uv`/venv setup was needed —
cheaper on RAM than spinning up a second environment):
`C:/Users/Lenovo/AppData/Local/Temp/claude/d--autoTesting/dd410a44-7522-428c-9b91-fda96de822cd/scratchpad/at334-falsify/`
(`urls_fixed.py` + `falsify_driver.py`). Never used `git stash`; the tracked worktree's `git
status` before and after showed only the 4 intended files, both times.

| claim | falsifying edit (in the throwaway copy) | check | observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| The fold is load-bearing — `/index.html` really does depend on the new `if fold_index and segments and segments[-1] in _INDEX_SEGMENTS` guard | Removed the two-line fold block entirely (commented out) | `url_template("/index.html", keep_host=False, fold_index=True)` | Baseline (fixed file): `'/'`. Mutated: `'/index.html'` — RED, exactly the filed duplicate-identity bug reproduced |
| The exact-match guard (`_INDEX_SEGMENTS`, not a suffix check) is load-bearing — it is what stops the fold from over-broadening | Changed the condition to `segments[-1].endswith(".html")` | `url_template("/myindex.html", keep_host=False, fold_index=True)` | Baseline (fixed file): `'/myindex.html'`. Mutated: `'/'` — RED, `myindex.html` incorrectly swallowed exactly as the brief warned against |

```
== baseline: fixed urls.py, unmodified ==
fold /index.html -> '/' (expect '/'): PASS
non-fold /myindex.html -> '/myindex.html' (expect '/myindex.html'): PASS

== mutation 1: remove the fold entirely ==
fold /index.html -> '/index.html' (fixed gives '/'): RED as expected -- fold is load-bearing

== mutation 2: over-broaden -- strip ANY segment ending in .html ==
non-fold /myindex.html -> '/' (fixed gives '/myindex.html'): RED as expected -- exact-match guard is load-bearing

== re-check the real fixed file is untouched by either mutation file ==
fixed file still folds correctly: PASS
fixed file still guards correctly: PASS
```

Tracked worktree `git status --porcelain` immediately after, confirming the falsification never
touched it:
```
 M src/autotester/core/urls.py
 M src/autotester/stages/screen_identity.py
 M tests/test_screen_identity.py
 M tests/test_urls.py
```
(exactly the 4 files this unit intended to change.)

**Not separately falsified (mutation-style):** the `fold_index` default-off behaviour and the
`screen_url_pattern` opt-in are exercised directly by
`test_fold_index_defaults_to_off_so_migrate_url_patterns_repair_is_unaffected` and
`test_screen_url_pattern_folds_trailing_index_html_like_node_identity_does`, and by the full
`test_migrate_url_patterns.py` suite passing unmodified (66 passed, above) — the discovery that
the default-off design was *necessary* (not just convenient) was itself found by running that
suite against the first, unconditional-fold version of the code and watching it go red; that red
run is reported under "How the fold_index design was found" in Gaps below rather than repeated
here as a separate mutation, since it was the actual TDD signal that produced the current design.

## Live browser evidence

Attempted once against `tests/test_explore_modal.py` (the real fixture named in AT-334,
`tests/fixtures/modal_site`) — timed out at 100s with no output in this environment, not retried.
No other live-browser test was run. See "RAM-gated deviation" above.

## Known limits / gaps (disclosed, not claimed)

- **Persisted-id consequence (asked for explicitly).** `ScreenNode.id` is `content_id("node",
  {"t": url_template, "s": signature})` (`schema/screen_graph.py:79-82`). Any already-stored
  `crawl.json`/`portal_persona.json` node whose `url_template` ends in `/index.html` or
  `/index.htm` will get a **different id** the next time that page is templated with
  `fold_index=True` (i.e. every future `node_from` call, and every future `screen_url_pattern`
  call for `Screen.url_pattern`). Checked the real committed project data under `projects/` for
  any current impact: `grep -rl "index.html\|index.htm" projects/` finds only navigate-step
  targets and one `project.json` `base_url` (`projects/regression-demo`), never a stored
  `url_pattern` value — `projects/checkerdemo/flowspec.json` has zero `"url_pattern"` occurrences
  today, and no `portal_persona.json` exists anywhere in the repo. **So this cycle changes nothing
  on disk; the consequence is prospective**, and would first show up as a persona/screenmap
  `key()` miss (`schema/portal_persona.py:74-77`) the first time a project with a stored
  `index.html`-suffixed pattern is re-crawled or re-ingested after this fix ships. Not migrated —
  out of this unit's scope and `projects/` data is explicitly off-limits.
- **How the `fold_index` design was found, for the checker's benefit:** the brief's own design
  section described an unconditional fold inside `url_template`. Building it that way and running
  `tests/test_migrate_url_patterns.py` (part of the "-k explore or crawl or url" verify surface)
  surfaced the two failures described above — a real, measured conflict with the frozen
  `scripts/migrate_url_patterns.py::repair`, not a hypothetical one. The opt-in parameter is the
  resolution; flagged in case the checker judges a different resolution (e.g., a T-135-gate answer
  that explicitly permits touching `repair`) preferable — that gate remains unanswered and this
  unit does not touch it either way.
- RAM-gated: neither the literal `-k "url or explore or crawl"` verify command nor a live crawl of
  `tests/fixtures/modal_site` completed in this environment (both timed out); see "How to verify"
  above for exactly what ran instead and why it is judged equivalent coverage for a pure
  identity-normalisation change.
- `qa/gates/t135-url-pattern-data-migration.md` was read and is otherwise untouched — its own
  unresolved question (whether to run the migration on `projects/erp/screenmap.json`) is unrelated
  to and unaffected by this fix.
- No `qa/contracts/` file names this exact criterion; flagged above for the checker to decide
  whether X15 should gain an explicit index-alias clause or a new criterion is warranted.

## Cycle 2 (AT-618, checker FAIL cycle 1)

**The FAIL:** cycle 1 folded `index.html` only at node identity
(`screen_identity.node_from`, `urls.screen_url_pattern`). Three seams that also
produce or compare a screen identity still called `url_template` unfolded —
`stages/coverage.py::_path_of` (`:26`, the coverage-diff comparison
coverage.md V1 governs), `stages/explore_merge.py::screen_from` (`:73`, where
a crawled `ScreenNode` becomes a stored `Screen.url_pattern`), and
`stages/merge_flowspec.py::_answered_gap_ids` (`:172`, the seam that closes a
`VideoRequest`). The checker reproduced it directly: an index-first crawl
persisted `Screen.url_pattern == '/index.html'`, and a run visiting `/` was
reported as a false `CoverageGap` even though master (pre-AT-334) correctly
saw both as one known screen.

### What changed

- `src/autotester/stages/coverage.py::_path_of` (`:25-36`) — now calls
  `url_template(url, keep_host=False, fold_index=True)`. This is the function
  both `diff_coverage`/`diff_crawl`'s `_known_paths`/`_crawled_paths` and
  `unreached_screens` route through, so every coverage-diff comparison folds
  consistently on both sides (coverage.md V1).
- `src/autotester/stages/explore_merge.py::screen_from` (`:73-78`) — now
  passes `fold_index=True` when deriving `Screen.url_pattern` from
  `node.url_example`. This matters beyond the coverage-diff path:
  `merge_screens`'s own rediscovery/conflict dedupe (`by_pattern`, `:142`) is a
  literal dict lookup on the STORED `url_pattern` string, never routed through
  `coverage._path_of` — so even after the `coverage.py` fix alone, a screen
  first crawled at `/` and rediscovered at `/index.html` would still have
  filed as a brand-new Screen instead of the AT-102 rediscovery it actually
  is. Folding at the point of storage (not just at the point of comparison)
  closes that gap too.
- `src/autotester/stages/merge_flowspec.py::_answered_gap_ids` (`:164-178`) —
  now folds when computing the path a stored `Screen.url_pattern` answers.
  This is the seam that CLOSES a `VideoRequest`; `coverage.py::_path_of` is
  the seam that OPENS one. They are independent functions (no shared helper),
  so both had to fold or a gap raised against `/` and answered by a screen
  whose stored pattern is the unfolded `/index.html` form would never resolve
  — the ask stays open forever even after the recording lands.
- `scripts/migrate_url_patterns.py::repair` (`:101`) — untouched, as cycle 1
  disclosed and the checker's fix direction confirmed: it sits behind its own
  unanswered gate (`qa/gates/t135-url-pattern-data-migration.md`) and pins
  `/index.html` as an unchanged remainder in its own tests. `grep -rn
  "url_template(" src/ scripts/` now shows exactly one caller without
  `fold_index=True` — this disclosed exception, and none of the other four.
- Tests added (all pure, no browser):
  - `tests/test_coverage.py` — `test_diff_crawl_folds_an_index_html_node_against_a_slash_pattern`
    (the `coverage.py` seam in isolation, via a hand-built `ScreenNode`, no
    `node_from` involved) plus the full-pipeline reproduction in **both
    orders** the checker asked for:
    `test_index_first_crawl_then_a_slash_visit_is_not_a_gap` and
    `test_slash_first_crawl_then_an_index_html_visit_is_not_a_gap` (real
    `node_from` -> real `screen_from` -> `diff_coverage`).
  - `tests/test_explore_merge.py` —
    `test_an_index_html_rediscovery_merges_with_a_slash_screen_instead_of_duplicating`,
    which isolates the `by_pattern` dedupe seam specifically (proven below to
    be independent of the `coverage.py` fix).
  - `tests/test_merge_flowspec_requests.py` —
    `test_a_stored_index_html_pattern_answers_a_slash_gap`, isolating the
    request-closing seam.

Same RAM-gated deviation as cycle 1 applies: the full `-k "url or explore or
crawl"` sweep and live-browser `test_explore_modal.py` are not re-run here
(no browser-touching code changed this cycle); the checker's own cycle-1
verdict already deferred the full suite and Mode D to cycle 2's checker pass.

### Capability coverage (each seam -> its own test + isolating falsification)

| seam | file:line | test | falsification (throwaway copy, see below) |
|---|---|---|---|
| coverage diff | `coverage.py::_path_of` :36 | `test_diff_crawl_folds_an_index_html_node_against_a_slash_pattern` | row 1 |

| full pipeline, slash-first | node_from -> screen_from -> diff_coverage | `test_slash_first_crawl_then_an_index_html_visit_is_not_a_gap` | (covered by rows 1+2 combined) |

Falsified in a throwaway copy OUTSIDE the tracked worktree (C7):
`C:/Users/Lenovo/AppData/Local/Temp/claude/d--autoTesting/dd410a44-7522-428c-9b91-fda96de822cd/scratchpad/at334-c2-falsify/`
(full `src/` + `tests/` + `scripts/regression_proof.py` copied in, run against
the worktree's own venv via `PYTHONPATH` pointed at the copy so no second
`uv sync` was needed). Each row: baseline (fixed copy) confirmed GREEN on the
named test **first**, then the one guard line was reverted to its cycle-1
(unfolded) form, the named test went RED, then the line was restored before
moving to the next row — never all three reverted at once, so each row proves
its OWN seam is load-bearing rather than being masked by another seam's fix.

| row | mutation | named test | baseline | mutated |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `coverage.py::_path_of` — dropped `fold_index=True` | `test_diff_crawl_folds_an_index_html_node_against_a_slash_pattern` | PASS | RED: `diff_crawl` returned a `CoverageGap` for `'/index.html'` against a spec pinned at `'/'` |
| 2 | `explore_merge.py::screen_from` — dropped `fold_index=True` | `test_an_index_html_rediscovery_merges_with_a_slash_screen_instead_of_duplicating` | PASS | RED: `assert 2 == 1` — the index-crawled node filed as a second Screen instead of merging with `scr_old` |
| 3 | `merge_flowspec.py::_answered_gap_ids` — dropped `fold_index=True` | `test_a_stored_index_html_pattern_answers_a_slash_gap` | PASS | RED: `open_requests(store)` still held the request after the answering merge — `assert [...] == []` failed |

Row 2 specifically disproves a plausible alternative theory (that fixing
`coverage.py` alone would have been sufficient): with only `coverage.py`
folding and `explore_merge.py` still unfolded, `test_index_first_crawl_then_a_slash_visit_is_not_a_gap`
still PASSES (coverage's own fold re-normalises both sides at compare time),
but `merge_screens`'s `by_pattern` dedupe — a separate, un-normalised
dict-key lookup — still breaks, which is exactly what row 2 catches and the
coverage-only test would have missed.

Tracked worktree `git status --porcelain` immediately after all three rows,
confirming the falsification never touched it (only the 6 files this cycle
intended to change):
```
 M src/autotester/stages/coverage.py
 M src/autotester/stages/explore_merge.py
 M src/autotester/stages/merge_flowspec.py
 M tests/test_coverage.py
 M tests/test_explore_merge.py
 M tests/test_merge_flowspec_requests.py
```
Never used `git stash`.

### Gaps (disclosed, not claimed)

- Live-browser confirmation (`tests/test_explore_modal.py` against
  `tests/fixtures/modal_site`) is still not run in this sandboxed environment
  — same RAM/timeout constraint as cycle 1. Left to the checker's Mode D, as
  cycle 1's verdict already deferred it here.
- The full `-k "url or explore or crawl"` sweep (~380 tests, 7 live-browser
  files) was not re-attempted this cycle for the same RAM reason; the targeted
  175-test run above covers every non-browser file touched by this fix plus
  the four other seams the checker named.
- The persisted-id consequence disclosed in cycle 1 (a stored `crawl.json`
  node id changes if its `url_template` ends in `/index.html`) is unaffected
  by this cycle's change — cycle 2 only extends WHERE the same fold is
  applied, not what it does at any one seam.

## Status: in-progress (cycle 2)
