# Manifest — at379-scrollable-pane-reachability

**Unit:** AT-379 — `visual_text` silently drops text below the fold of a scrollable pane
**Contract:** `qa/contracts/ui.md` (U13) · `qa/contracts/core-invariants.md` (C2, C7)
**Goal task:** none — issue-driven
**Date:** 2026-09-16
**Fix cycle:** 3 of max 3 — **the last one**
**Dual check:** no
**Issues addressed:** AT-379 (medium, open → fixed — **both halves now**) ·
AT-392 (high, cycle-1 FAIL) · AT-393 (low, cycle-1 FAIL) · AT-394 (low, cycle-1 FAIL) ·
AT-398 (medium, filed against my own work in cycle 2) ·
AT-408, AT-409, AT-412 (cycle-2 FAIL) · AT-411 (my git error; fixed by the other loop as AT-407)

## Cycle 3 — the fourth occurrence, and a mutation body I missed

The cycle-2 verdict confirmed AT-392 was discharged and then failed the unit on the sentence written
in its place. Four findings, all answered in code:

| Finding | sev | Answer |
|---|---|---|
| **AT-408** — `reachOf` did NOT accumulate "every scrollable ancestor": it returned at the first ancestor scrolling on ONE axis, which is what an ordinary `overflow:auto` pane is | high | **Fixed.** The walk goes all the way up, carrying a running offset **and** a running clip intersection. |
| **AT-409** — the AT-358 spec's masked-text-run row kept a stale `clipRect(` in its mutation **body**, so it threw a `ReferenceError` and reddened all 23 tests instead of the 1 it names | high | **Fixed.** 21/21 was preserved while the attribution was destroyed — the count is what a careless reader checks, and I was the careless reader. |
| **AT-412** — the `window.scrollY == 0` guard did not protect the AT-392 test from the drift the manifest credited it with | medium | **Fixed.** The test now asserts the pane's first line actually reaches a **negative viewport coordinate** — the only state in which the rule is load-bearing. |
| **AT-393** (again) | low | **Fixed rather than disclosed.** The running intersection closes the nested-clip false positive in the same edit as AT-408. |

**This is the fourth time this line has been wrong in the same direction.** AT-373, AT-379, AT-392,
now AT-408 — every one a fix for false positives that manufactured a false negative of the AT-355
shape, in the module about to be wired into a crawl that scrolls panes. The source says so at the
line, compactly, with the ledger ids for the detail.

### AT-409 is the one I want on the record

I repointed four `clipRect` occurrences after the rename and re-ran: **21/21 killed**, so I reported
the spec as intact. Three were anchors; the fourth was a mutation **body**. A mutation body that no
longer compiles does not stop killing — it reddens *everything*, which still satisfies "the named
test failed". The count survives and the isolation is gone. Checking the number instead of the
attribution is exactly the failure C7 exists to prevent, and it was in my own verification step.

### My fixtures were weak four separate times this cycle, and every one was caught by a SURVIVED row

Not one came from reading the code:

1. The nested-pane test's inner pane overflowed by ~400px, so **its own** offset satisfied the
   document-edge rule and dropping the outer one changed nothing. Inner overflow cut to ~8px so the
   outer's ~892px is unmistakably what carries the glyph back.
2. The spacer sat **above** the inner pane, so scrolling the outer brought it **into** view and
   nothing reached a negative coordinate. The test failed loudly rather than passing vacuously —
   the good version of being wrong. Spacer moved below.
3. The nested-clip test had only the **outer** box binding, so an identity `narrow()` still excluded
   the line via the outermost box and the intersection was never exercised. A second case was added
   where the **inner** box is the binding one.
4. The nested-pane assertion used substrings, and after scrolling the outer pane its own first line
   and the inner pane's land on the **same screen row**, so the detector interleaves them
   (`OINUNTEERR__TTOOPP…`). That is correct behaviour for a visual-order detector and the assertion
   was wrong, not the code. Sorted-character equality is the right shape: nothing dropped, nothing
   invented, order free to change.

### What I am NOT fixing here, and why

**AT-410** (high) — the checker found the cause of AT-398 that I could not: the **first**
`Range.getBoundingClientRect()` inside a `content-visibility`-skipped subtree returns an all-zero
rect, `glyphsOf`'s width guard drops that glyph, and the same query forces layout so every later
measurement is correct. It reproduces on the **unmutated shipping detector** on a plain
`content-visibility:auto` page, and callers call once.

That is a genuine missed-credential defect and it is **not this unit's**: it predates the unit, the
checker explicitly did not charge it, and this is fix cycle 3 of 3. Adding a fifth concern to the
last cycle would risk the four that are answered. **It must close before `visual_text` is wired into
the crawl** — the same standing condition AT-379 carried, and for the same reason.

### AT-411 — my git error, and its correction

My cycle-2 commit used `git add tests/` and swept in `tests/test_flake_probe.py`. I then made it
worse: believing it untracked, I ran `git rm --cached`, which removed a **tracked** file (part of
the other loop's PASSed AT-386 work) from HEAD. The other loop re-tracked it as AT-407 in `5e9ae80`;
verified present in HEAD and unmodified on disk. I wrote "never a bare directory pathspec" into
three checker dispatches this session before doing it myself, and the second mistake came from
acting on an assumption I could have checked with one command.

## Cycle 2 — I fixed half of what AT-379 was filed for

The cycle-1 verdict verified every claim the code made and then failed the unit on the half I had
not noticed I was leaving:

> **AT-392 (high)** — a pane scrolled away from its origin still drops everything before its offset,
> on both axes. `PANETOP` dropped at `scrollTop=602`; `HPLEFT` dropped at `scrollLeft=1200`.

`isReachable` added only `window.scrollX/scrollY`, so the **window** case worked and the **pane**
case did not — and AT-379's own filed evidence names the scrolled pane explicitly. Marking it
`open → fixed` was a claim the evidence did not support.

**That line has now been wrong three times in the same direction**, and the pattern is the finding:

| | the rule | what vanished |
|---|---|---|
| **AT-373** | tested `rect.right <= 0` against the viewport | everything above the window's fold |
| **AT-379** | treated a scrollable pane's box as a hard clip | everything below the pane's fold |
| **AT-392** | added only `window.scrollX/scrollY` | everything before a scrolled pane's offset |

Every one was a fix for false **positives** that manufactured a false **negative** of the AT-355
shape — a credential rendering in plain type while this returns a clean string. Every one asked
*"can a reader SEE this?"* and forgot *"can a reader REACH it?"*. That is written into the source
at the line itself now, as a table, because three occurrences is a pattern and the next person to
touch that line should meet it before they edit it.

`clipRect` is replaced by `reachOf`, which returns `{clip, scrollX, scrollY}` — the accumulated
scroll offset of the window **and** every scrollable ancestor. A glyph is unreachable only if it
sits before the document origin after everything scrollable is scrolled back.

### The test I wrote for it was weak twice, and the mutation run is what said so

Neither weakness came from reasoning; both came from a SURVIVED row.

1. **The pane sat ~2000px down a tall page**, so scrolling it internally never pushed anything to a
   negative viewport coordinate. Measured: first line at `top=302`, never negative.
2. **After moving it to the top of the viewport, the mutation still survived** — because the
   *window* was then scrolled ~1600px, and the document-edge rule adds `window.scrollY`, so every
   glyph tested as reachable on the window's offset alone. Measured: `top=-798`, but
   `-798 + 1602 > 0`.

The pane's own contribution is only isolated when the window contributes **nothing**. AT-392 now has
its own short fixture, `scrolled_panes.html`, and the test asserts `window.scrollY == 0` before it
measures — otherwise the fixture could silently drift tall again and take the test's meaning with it.

### AT-393 — the disclosure was wrong and I have corrected it

I called the nested-clip false positive "pre-existing". The checker measured that it is **introduced
here**: pre-fix `NESTBELOW` False, post-fix True, because before this change a scrollable pane's own
box bounded its content. The structure is pre-existing; the consequence is not. Corrected below.

### AT-398 — this cycle filed an issue against its own work

Restoring the AT-358 spec after the rename, the closed-`<details>` mutation **survived**. The cause
is not the rename: with the guard bypassed the detector returns `ETAILSBODY_SENTINEL_77` — exactly
one character short — so the `not in` assertion passed. The `D` at index 0 has a real rect
(`w=11.5625, x=8, y=182`), `reachOf` returns `clip=null`, and it still never enters `items`.

**Silently dropping a glyph is this module's core failure mode**, so I filed it as **AT-398** rather
than absorbing it. The fixture sentinel moved off index 0 (`<p>body: DETAILSBODY_SENTINEL_77</p>`),
which restored 21/21 — and that workaround is named here as a workaround, not presented as a fix.

## Why this one, ahead of the queue's top rows

`qa/QUEUE.md`'s top-3 are AT-357 (closed this session), AT-368 and AT-335. **AT-368 and AT-335 are
both in flight with the other maker loop** — `qa/manifests/at368-loop-liveness-visible.md` exists,
and `scripts/flake_probe.py` is AT-335's reproduction harness being built right now. Taking either
would be a double-assignment on a shared working tree.

AT-379 is the right unit instead, and not merely because it is free: **it is a hole my own unit left,
and it must close before `visual_text` acquires its first caller.** The AT-358 cycle-3 checker found
it, declined to fail cycle 3 on it (the cycle-2 checker's scope bound was already written down), and
filed it against the follow-up crawl-wiring unit. Wiring the detector into a crawl while this is
open would ship a known false negative into the exact caller that triggers it.

## The defect

A credential rendered below the fold of an `overflow:auto` pane returned a **clean string**. That is
the AT-355 shape — the thing this entire module exists to catch — and it is the **second time in
this module that a fix for false positives manufactured a false negative**. AT-373 was the first
(text above the scroll fold). The pattern is worth naming: every one of these came from tightening
"what a reader can see" without asking what a reader can *reach*.

The module's own rule is reachability, stated in its own comment — *"further down or right can be
scrolled to, so those stay"* — and a reader can scroll an `overflow:auto` pane and read every line
of it. `clipRect` did not distinguish a pane from a clip. The comment I wrote in cycle 3 asserted
the opposite and was simply false:

> the clip intersection stays viewport-relative and is correct that way: a clipping ancestor and its
> content scroll together

They scroll together when the **window** scrolls. When the **pane** scrolls, they do not — that is
what scrolling a pane means.

## What changed

- `src/autotester/browser/visual_order.js` — `clipRect` is replaced by **`reachOf`**, which returns
  `{clip, scrollX, scrollY}`: it no longer reports a genuinely scrollable ancestor as a clip
  (AT-379), and it accumulates the scroll offset of the window **and** every scrollable ancestor
  (AT-392). The false comment in `isReachable` is replaced by the three-occurrence table. 297 lines.
- `tests/fixtures/bidi_site/unreadable.html` — a scrollable pane and an `overflow:hidden` pane, same
  shape, different overflow, one sentinel per line. The `<details>` sentinel moved off index 0 —
  a disclosed workaround for **AT-398**, not a fix for it.
- `tests/fixtures/bidi_site/scrolled_panes.html` — **new**; AT-392's own short page, deliberately
  too short for the window to scroll (see above for why that is load-bearing).
- `tests/test_browser_unreadable.py` — **new file**; the false-positive half split out under
  doctor's 300-line cap (see below). Carries both new tests.
- `tests/conftest.py` — the `page_factory` fixture moved here, so the two halves share one copy.
  The dead `SITE` constant it duplicated is deleted from the old file (**AT-394**).
- `qa/evidence/at379-scrollable-pane-reachability/mutations.json` — **5** mutations.
- `qa/evidence/at358-visual-order-detector/mutations.json` — 4 anchors repointed after the
  `clipRect` → `reachOf` rename. Re-run below: **21/21 still kill**, same named tests.

### Scrollable vs clipping is measured, not guessed

A pane scrolls only if its computed overflow is `auto`/`scroll` **and** its content actually
overflows (`scrollHeight > clientHeight`). `overflow:hidden` with nothing to scroll still clips, and
**the boundary is asserted in the same test as the fix** — a change that simply reported everything
would satisfy the positive assertions on its own, so the hidden pane's below-fold line must still be
absent.

Per axis, deliberately: `overflow-y:auto; overflow-x:hidden` is an ordinary pane, and it really does
hide what runs off its right edge while really exposing what runs off its bottom. The scrollable
axis is unbounded in the returned box; the other keeps the element's real edge.

### The file split, and why the fixture moved

The new test pushed `tests/test_browser_visual_order.py` to 321 lines. The seam is the one the
module already has: that file asks whether the detector **sees what the DOM hides** (bidi overrides,
zero-width interleaving, control values, reading order); `tests/test_browser_unreadable.py` asks the
opposite question, which is a different kind of claim — a box can be painted and show nothing, and
reporting it costs the false-positive rate in this product's north star.

Both halves need a real Chromium page over the same fixture directory, so `page_factory` moved to
`tests/conftest.py` rather than being copied. A copy in each file would be the "one concept, two
places" the design rules call a bug — and the cycle-1 checker of the previous unit checked exactly
that property with an AST overlap comparison.

## Capability coverage (each new claim → its isolating falsification)

All three rows are single-hunk edits to `src/autotester/browser/visual_order.js`, named in "What
changed". `observed` is the pasted runner output below; the runner refuses to start against a red
baseline, so each named test is green before its edit, and it prints `claims to kill` against
`actually failed` so the kill is attributed rather than merely a non-zero exit.

| capability | the check that covers it | the falsifying edit | observed |
|---|---|---|---|
| text below the fold of a scrollable pane is reported (AT-379) | `test_text_below_the_fold_of_a_scrollable_pane_is_reported` | `const scrollsY = false` | KILLED (row 1) |
| an `overflow:hidden` pane still clips — the boundary holds | same, **and** `…is_not_reported[overflow-clipped]` | widen `SCROLLS` to include `hidden` | KILLED (row 2) |
| the scrollable axis is genuinely unbounded, not merely detected | `test_text_below_the_fold_of_a_scrollable_pane_is_reported` | `bottom: box.bottom` | KILLED (row 3) |
| a vertically scrolled pane loses nothing before its offset (AT-392) | `test_a_pane_the_reader_already_scrolled_loses_nothing` | drop `scrollY += node.scrollTop` | KILLED (row 4) |
| a horizontally scrolled pane loses nothing before its offset (AT-392) | same | drop `scrollX += node.scrollLeft` | KILLED (row 5) |
| offsets accumulate across NESTED scrollable panes (AT-408) | `test_a_scrolled_pane_inside_a_scrolled_pane_loses_nothing` | return at the first clipping ancestor instead of walking on | KILLED (row 6) |
| clips are INTERSECTED up the chain, so an inner box cannot leak past an outer one (AT-393) | `test_a_pane_inside_a_clipping_box_does_not_leak_past_it` | `const narrow = (box) => box` | KILLED (row 7) |

Row 2 is the one that matters most: it falsifies the fix **from the other side**, by making the
detector too permissive rather than too strict, and it kills on both the new test and the existing
clipped-text test.

## How to verify (commands + expected)

- `uv run pytest` → expected: `1235 passed, 2 skipped`
  *(`uv run pytest -q` resolves to `-qq` — `pyproject.toml` `addopts` already carries `-q` — and
  suppresses the summary line. Exit 0 is the signal.)*
- `uv run ruff check src tests scripts` → expected: `All checks passed!`
- `uv run autotester doctor` → expected: `doctor: clean`
- `uv run pytest tests/test_browser_visual_order.py tests/test_browser_unreadable.py` → expected:
  25 passed (real Chromium; skips cleanly if the browser binary is absent)
- `uv run python scripts/mutation_check.py qa/evidence/at379-scrollable-pane-reachability/mutations.json`
  → expected: `7/7 mutations killed` (C7)
- **Regression on the unit this one amends:**
  `uv run python scripts/mutation_check.py qa/evidence/at358-visual-order-detector/mutations.json`
  → expected: `21/21 mutations killed`. The split moved test nodeids, so both specs were repointed;
  this run is what proves none of AT-358's twenty-one kills was lost in the move.

Per-mutation attribution is in each evidence directory's `mutations.out`.

The `1235` total includes tests belonging to the **other maker loop** (AT-368 liveness and AT-335's
flake probe, in flight in this shared tree). This unit adds **one** test; the rest is not mine and
is not claimed.

## Live browser evidence

The unit's own tests **are** the live browser evidence: a real Chromium against a real HTTP server,
asserting measured glyph positions, which is the only way this claim can be checked at all. The
cycle-3 checker of AT-358 independently reproduced the defect in its own browser before filing it —
`qa/evidence/browser-at358-visual-order-detector-2026-09-16-checker-c3/report.json`.

## What remains open, deliberately

The module's `WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE` block is unchanged and still accurate: shadow roots,
same-origin frames, the generated-content class, `<select>` option text, `<canvas>`, `title`/`alt`.
This unit closes a false negative inside the territory the detector already claims; it does not
widen that territory.

`reachOf` returns at the **first** clipping ancestor rather than intersecting every clip up the
chain, so a pane nested inside a second clipping box can report text the outer box hides.

**This false positive is INTRODUCED by this unit, not pre-existing** (AT-393). Cycle 1 of this
manifest called it pre-existing and the checker measured otherwise: before the change, a scrollable
pane's own box bounded its content, so the outer clip never had to be consulted. The structure is
old; the consequence is new. The direction is the deliberate one — a false positive costs the north
star's false-positive term, a false negative costs a missed credential — but calling a new cost an
old one is the kind of disclosure error this unit has now been charged for twice.

## Status: ready-for-check
