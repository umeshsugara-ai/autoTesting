# Manifest — t122-first-login-run (first logged-in Pathlynks run, D-068 account-derived approval)

## Status: ready-for-check

Goal task: T-122 · Branch: wave/t122-first-login-run · Base: af8f3218 (origin/master after the d063 + T-151 merges)
Policy-Version: proportional-verification/2026-10-06.6
Fix cycle: 1 of 2
Dual check: no
Tier: S (no product code, schema, config or test changed; the diff is this manifest, qa/evidence/t122-first-login-run-2026-10-07/, and tracked project data under projects/pathlynks/: cases.jsonl, project.json). The claim is a live-product result, so it is not a docs-lane close: only /checker can PASS it.
Executor: claude (main builder session, no delegation: the unit is a single live run)
Contract: none exists for T-122 itself. `qa/contracts/pathlynks-first-run.md` is T-050's contract (3 login cases); `qa/contracts/consent.md` CN* governs the approval path. Judged against the T-122 goal row below plus `core-invariants.md` and `browser-and-secrets.md`.
Gate answers that apply (word for word):
- `qa/gates/pathlynks-user-account-first.md`: "sabse phle pathlynks user account use krro, vo working credentials hai" (first target is the USER account, `PATHLYNKS_USER_*`, not the counsellor account).
- D-068 (docs/DECISIONS.md:2021): "provisioned credentials are the run approval ... Approval rows are still minted and HMAC-signed automatically, as an audit record, not as a human step." ADVERSARIAL still has no automatic grant.

## Acceptance criteria (verbatim from `.goal/goal.json` T-122)

- title: "Track 0 tail: login case + first logged-in Pathlynks run (credentials present; ERP is the second product)"
- done_check: `{"type": "cmd", "cmd": "uv run pytest tests/test_execute.py tests/test_run_case_pipeline.py", "expect_exit": 0}`
- note (CAVEAT, do not drop): "the same pair was rejected 401 on 2026-09-21 and the cause was never found, so any unit on this path must FAIL CLOSED naming AT-529 rather than assume authentication succeeds ... Write tier: ALLOW_WRITES is authorized (qa/gates/write-policy-tier.md, D-053); the supplied account's own permissions are the boundary. Each run still needs its own RunApproval." (the last sentence is superseded by D-068: the credential-derived row is the approval)
- Operating brief from the orchestrator: use only the `PATHLYNKS_*` keys the project declares; never print credential values; no adversarial cases; real visible browser; evidence under `qa/evidence/t122-*/`.

## Result per criterion

| # | Criterion | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | done_check green | MET. `uv run pytest tests/test_execute.py tests/test_run_case_pipeline.py` = 20 passed (run in this worktree at base af8f3218 before the live run; no code changed after) | command output in the builder log; re-run by the checker |
| C2 | Login case (`case_35b17ccece2d`, project `login_case_id`) exists and ran against production Pathlynks in a real visible browser (`project.json` `headed: true`) with the `PATHLYNKS_USER_*` pair | MET. Two live runs, each 4 steps, `duration_s` 21.6 and ~22; the browser reached the signed-in dashboard (screenshot `04-step04-click.png`: "Find your direction, PathLynks.", sidebar Dashboard, Logout). No 401, no login error on screen. | `qa/evidence/t122-first-login-run-2026-10-07/run-01M4ATYY74FJJNK62P3702JDZJ/` and `.../run-01M4AV0R6AKHH1M7C77FW2SV22/` |
| C3 | Fail closed naming AT-529 if authentication is not obtained | NOT EXERCISED, and not needed: authentication succeeded both times, so the AT-529 branch (the 2026-09-21 401) did not fire. The 401 cause is still unknown; this run is one more data point that the pair authenticates today (2026-10-07 09:26Z and 09:27Z). | same dirs; no 401 in either run |
| C4 | Approval: D-068 account-derived LIVE_CASE row minted by `core/consent.py::prepare_account_grant`, signed, verified | MET. Rows `appr_bad2891357df` and `appr_140cc431882e` (granted_by `account-derived:D-068`, kind `live_case`, 4 actions, 80 probes, 32 s, scope = the two declared USER keys on `pathlynks.vidysea.com`, not production-flagged). The second run minted a fresh row because the first expired after its 32 s window. | `approval-rows-minted.jsonl` (signature elided) |
| C5 | No adversarial case ran; no counsellor key used; no value printed | MET. Only the BEST login case ran (WORST wrong-password and EDGE empty-submit cases were not run). Keys named in the run: `PATHLYNKS_USER_EMAIL`, `PATHLYNKS_USER_PASSWORD`. Screenshots 02/03 show the email blurred and the password field masked. `scripts/check_no_secrets.py` over the evidence dir and `qa/manifests`: 298 files, 0 leaks. | screenshots + script output |
| C6 | The case verdicts PASS | MET at cycle 1 (see Cycle 1 section). Cycle 0 was NOT MET: stale oracle 'YOUR PROGRESS', answered gate A / D-072 item 1 (section removed on purpose). Re-authored login case `case_cfa40e6b95c2` (step 4 expects 'Logout' and 'Dashboard'): outcome=completed, both assertions met, judge (gemini) PASS, 2 of 2 live runs. | `cycle1/run-01M4B13T7QH17156NNK2PWGEYS/`, `cycle1/run-01M4B2KP0PQQ2NZTGYBQ463YWW/`; cycle-0 FAIL kept in `run-01M4AV0R6AKHH1M7C77FW2SV22/` |

Finding for the human or `/checker` (PROPOSED-ISSUE, the maker did not edit the case): the login case's step-4 oracle `visible_text: ['YOUR PROGRESS']` is stale against the current production dashboard, so a correct login verdicts FAIL (a false positive, the failure the north star refuses). Smallest fix: re-author the step-4 expectation to a marker the page shows today (for example "Your journey" or the "Logout" control), which changes the content-addressed case id and `project.json` `login_case_id`. Both live under `projects/pathlynks/` (tracked project data), so it is not done in this diff.

Second finding (judge availability): `LangChainFallbackProvider().available()` is False unless `core.env.load_repo_env()` ran first. The UI and CLI call it; my first driver did not, which produced run 01M4ATYY... with `INCONCLUSIVE` "grader failed" (not a product defect). Run 01M4AV0R... is the real-judge run. Kept both as evidence of the two states.

## What ran (no code changed)

- Worktree `D:/autoTesting/.worktrees/t122-first-login-run` off origin/master (af8f3218), `uv sync`, `AUTOTESTER_ROOT` pointed at the worktree and the repo-root `.env` copied in (gitignored; removed after the run) so the main working tree was not touched.
- `driver-single-case-run.py` is the UI `trigger_run` path (`ui/routes_runs.py`: `_require_declared_values` -> `_require_live_case_approval` -> `_execute_with_trace` -> `store.save_run`) restricted to the project's one `login_case_id`, because `trigger_run` itself runs every case and would include the wrong-password WORST case.
- Approval rows and run dirs were written under the worktree's `projects/pathlynks/` (runs dir is gitignored; `approvals.jsonl` is tracked and is left uncommitted).

## Falsification rows (in a copy, `AUTOTESTER_ROOT` = a scratch dir with only project.json, cases.jsonl and a dummy `.env`; no real credentials; driver `falsification-consent.py`)

| Claim | Falsifying edit | Observed | Restored |
|---|---|---|---|
| C4: only account-derived kinds get an automatic grant | ask `prepare_account_grant(kind=ADVERSARIAL)` | red: `ApprovalRequired: no automatic account grant exists for adversarial runs` | n/a, no file edited |
| C4: the grant is bound to declared keys | ask for a grant naming an undeclared key `NOT_DECLARED_KEY` | red: `ApprovalRequired: referenced account key NOT_DECLARED_KEY is unavailable or out of scope` | n/a |
| C4/C2: control, a declared pair with a key present mints a row | LIVE_CASE with the two declared keys | green: row minted | n/a |
| C4: signing key missing refuses | unset `AUTOTESTER_APPROVAL_KEY` (and none in `.env`) | NOT refused: the key is auto-provisioned into the repo-root `.env` (the AT-674 `ensure_approval_key` design; the scratch `.env` gained an `AUTOTESTER_APPROVAL_KEY=` line). So "missing key refuses" is not a property of this path; do not claim it. | n/a |
| C6: the verdict reflects the oracle | run 01 and run 02 both red on the same stale 'YOUR PROGRESS' marker while the screenshot shows a successful login | red in both (reproduced, not flaky: p measured 2 of 2) | n/a |

## Test scope

Builder ran only the T-122 done_check files (S): `tests/test_execute.py tests/test_run_case_pipeline.py` = 20 passed. No removed or renamed names (no code diff). No full suite. Production writes: none beyond the login session itself (BEST login case only; the account's own permissions are the boundary, D-053).

## Cycle 1 (fix cycle 1: re-author the stale login oracle, gate D-072 item 1 = A)

Merged origin/master (642ab4bd) into the branch first (ab20de0b, clean merge). Screenshot `04-step04-click.png` shows the signed-in dashboard: heading "Find your direction, PathLynks.", sidebar Dashboard / My Space / ... / Logout, "YOUR NEXT CHAPTER", "Your journey". Marker choice: the two nav controls `Logout` and `Dashboard`, which only exist when signed in and are not marketing copy (the heading and the section labels are copy and have already changed once).

How the case was edited (no hand-edit of a content-addressed id): `qa/evidence/.../cycle1/reauthor_login_case.py` uses the project's store path: build a `Case` (id computed by `Case.compute_id`, as `ui/routes_cases.py::create_case` does), `ProjectStore.add_case`, then `ProjectStore.update_case` marks the old row `status: retired` (id kept so its runs and the cycle-0 FAIL stay attached), then `save_project` repoints `login_case_id`. Old `case_35b17ccece2d` -> new `case_cfa40e6b95c2`. `cases.jsonl` was rewritten in the store's compact JSON, so the diff touches all 4 rows textually; only the retired flag on the old row and the new row differ in content. `project.json` also gained the schema defaults `max_parallel: 1` and `permitted_surface: []` from the same save. `ProjectStore` does not filter retired cases anywhere (RETIRED is only an enum), so `trigger_run` would still run the retired case; this run used the driver restricted to `login_case_id`.

Live runs (headed, `AUTOTESTER_ROOT` = worktree, temp `.env` copy deleted before commit, `load_repo_env()` so the real judge is available, UI `trigger_run` sequence restricted to `login_case_id`, D-068 approval auto-minted, BEST case only, no adversarial case, no value printed):

| Run | Case | Outcome | Assertions | Judge verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| run-01M4B13T7QH17156NNK2PWGEYS | case_cfa40e6b95c2 | completed | 'Logout' met, 'Dashboard' met | PASS (gemini, Criteria 1/1 met, 4 of 4 images seen) |
| run-01M4B2KP0PQQ2NZTGYBQ463YWW | case_cfa40e6b95c2 | completed, 29.1 s of the 32 s approval window | both met | PASS (gemini) |

Falsification of the new oracle (scratch root, copy of the case with step-4 marker `Zzz Absent Marker 9931`, no repo files edited):
- Execute layer: red as it should be. run-01M4B16YD6FQ0Q9YBHTCGTBJTX: `outcome=assertion_failed`, "expected to contain 'Zzz Absent Marker 9931'" unmet.
- Judge layer: NOT red. The same run's verdict is `PASS` ("Criteria 1/1 met"), and 6 offline re-grades of that recorded evidence with the real judge were PASS 6 of 6 (`cycle1/regrade-tally.txt`). So the brief's falsification expectation (absent marker -> judge FAIL) is NOT MET. Cause (read from code, not fixed here): `stages/run_case_pipeline.py::default_rubric` grades "the evidence is consistent with: <case rationale>", and the login case rationale ("proves the credential boundary + execute/grade pipeline ...") never mentions the step expectations, so the judge weighs the unmet assertion only by chance (the old stale-marker evidence re-graded FAIL 4, PASS 2 of 6). D-032 deliberately lets the judge overrule an unmet assertion. Consequence: a login that really fails to show the marker can still come back PASS; the deterministic `outcome` is the reliable signal today.
- Four further scratch falsification attempts (11:22 to 11:39Z) ended `errored: run budget exhausted: wall_clock_s` (the 32 s approval window; production login took 22 to 44 s that hour, and the real case ran 29.1 s in the same window), so no more live falsification runs were made. No login error on screen; screenshot of the last one shows the filled sign-in form.

PROPOSED-ISSUE (for the checker or human, not built here): (1) the default rubric does not carry a case's `expected` assertions, so an unmet assertion can verdict PASS (false negative, the failure the north star refuses); smallest fix: render the unmet/met assertion evidence into the criterion text or make an `assertion_failed` outcome a floor on the verdict unless the judge cites evidence against the assertion. Needs a human choice against D-032. (2) The approval wall clock (32 s for a 4-step login) leaves about 3 s of headroom on a slow production hour; a login that takes 33 s errors instead of passing.

Test scope (cycle 1): `tests/test_execute.py tests/test_run_case_pipeline.py` = 20 passed (the done_check); `tests/test_run_pathlynks_first_cases.py tests/test_ui_case_management.py tests/test_ui_cases.py tests/test_ui_runs_live_case_approval.py tests/test_ui_case_navigate_reachability.py` = 42 passed; `uv run ruff check src tests scripts` = All checks passed; `uv run autotester doctor` = clean; `scripts/check_no_secrets.py qa/evidence/t122-first-login-run-2026-10-07 qa/manifests` = 327 files, 0 leaks. No tests reference the old case id or 'YOUR PROGRESS' (`git grep` over tests, src, docs, qa/contracts: only docs/DECISIONS.md history). No full suite. Production writes: login sessions only (BEST case; 3 logins of the new case plus 1 scratch falsification login that completed, plus 4 that timed out), account's own permissions are the boundary (D-053).

Left uncommitted on purpose: `projects/pathlynks/approvals.jsonl` (run-state rows, signature included; minted rows with signatures elided are in `cycle1/approval-rows-minted.jsonl`), and `projects/pathlynks/runs/` (gitignored).
