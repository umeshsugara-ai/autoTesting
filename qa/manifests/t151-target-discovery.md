# Manifest — t151-target-discovery
**Contract:** qa/contracts/ai-target.md (AI1, AI8 bind T-151; core-invariants C5/C7)
**Goal task:** T-151
**Date:** 2026-10-07
**Fix cycle:** 2 of max 2
**Dual check:** required   <!-- credential refusal, path-escape and approval gating are a security boundary -->
**Persona walk:** skip (backend-only: no human screen; Track C below-the-UI discovery)
**Issues addressed:** none
**Executor:** claude-sonnet-subagent
**Executor rationale:** gate answered; merge of master + manifest close-out by a maker subagent in the t151 worktree; no external executor worthy.

## What changed
Cycle-2 fixes (both cycle-1 FAILs, fix list items 1-7). Complete list from `git diff --name-only 2fae2504...HEAD` follows the fixes.
- Merge of master into the branch (D-065, D-063/D-066 gate files, issues row now present; `qa/.last-tick` not committed). Dangling-citation doctor violations for D-065 and `tests/test_citations.py::test_the_real_tree_has_no_dangling_citation` are green.
- src/autotester/stages/text_lines.py (new, 18) — one shared line splitter (`split_lines`, `first_nonblank_line`): lines are counted by 
, 

 and 
 only. Replaces the three `str.splitlines()` call sites in read_context.py and discover.py (U+2028/U+2029/U+0085///- no longer shift Signal lines).
- src/autotester/stages/credential_files.py (new, 16) — credential denylist moved out of discover.py (which would otherwise exceed 300 lines) and extended: .envrc .npmrc .netrc .pypirc .htpasswd *.jks *.keystore *.p8 id_ecdsa credentials.yml secrets.yaml service-account.json token.json.
- src/autotester/stages/discover.py (286) — `_emit` enforces `max_signals` (refusal `signal_budget`) and the deadline per Signal; `scan` refuses a file with `parse_depth` on RecursionError/MemoryError and continues; the final deadline check now runs after `redactor.assert_clean`.
- src/autotester/stages/read_context.py (164) — `_guard` (signal budget + deadline inside the tag/frontmatter emission loop), final deadline after `assert_clean`, per-file `parse_depth` refusal, `_metadata` refuses a cyclic structure as `yaml_alias` instead of recursing.
- src/autotester/schema/ai_target.py — `ScanLimits.max_signals` (default 2000, ge=1, le=20000; `extra="forbid"` kept).
- tests/test_discover_hardening.py (new, 158; 27 cases) — committed defenders. NOTE: tests/test_discover.py is already at the 300-line cap (doctor C2 counts tests/), so the new cases could not be appended to it; they live in this sibling file instead of test_discover.py (deviation from fix-list wording, forced by the file-size rule).
- docs/MAP.md, docs/SNAPSHOT.md — regenerated (`autotester map`, `autotester snapshot`).
- Carried from cycle 1 (already on the branch): src/autotester/prompts/ai_target_classify_v1.md, src/autotester/providers/mock.py (`act` hunk), pyproject.toml / uv.lock (`pyyaml==6.0.3`), tests/test_discover.py (63 cases), docs/DECISIONS.md (D-065 via master), qa/gates/d063-cn5-vs-cn11.md, qa/gates/d063-self-grant-csrf.md, qa/gates/t151-dependency-authorization.md, qa/gates/t196-l10-coverage.md, qa/issues.jsonl (all from master), qa/checkpoints/t151-target-discovery.md and .b.md, qa/verdicts/t151-target-discovery.md, .b.md, -scoped-cycle1.md, -repair-scoped-cycle1.md (checker records), qa/evidence/t151-independent-cycle1-2026-10-05/ (alias-independent-results.json, results.json, t151_checker_mutations.py, t151_checker_probe.py, t151_checker_yaml_proof.py), qa/evidence/t151-independent-rebind-cycle1-2026-10-05/ (results.json, t151_checker_rebind_mutations.py, test_checker_yaml.py), qa/evidence/t151-independent-repair-cycle1-2026-10-05/ (repair-results.json, t151_checker_repair_mutations.py, t151_checker_repair_probe.py), qa/evidence/t151-maker-cycle1-2026-10-05/ (native-tool-receipt.md, t151_maker_filesystem_probe.py), qa/manifests/t151-target-discovery.md (this file).

## Verification scope
Policy-Version: proportional-verification/2026-10-06.6
Tier: L (dependency bump + credential, path-escape and approval boundary)
Base SHA: master 2fae2504 merged (merge commits on the branch; D-065 present). Checked state: branch codex/t151-target-discovery HEAD at ready-for-check (re-bind SHA and dirty diff hash at Mode A)
Gate answers (qa/gates/t151-dependency-authorization.md, verbatim): "Answered: 2026-10-07 — A — chat (Umesh): approve all three (pyyaml==6.0.3, the target-discovery prompt file, the mock.py act hunk). DECISIONS entry to follow." Recorded as D-065 (docs/DECISIONS.md, Approved-by Umesh); Changes-authorized: pyproject.toml / uv.lock (pyyaml==6.0.3) · src/autotester/prompts/ai_target_classify_v1.md · src/autotester/providers/mock.py `act` hunk.
Affected tests / full-suite trigger: tests/test_discover.py (63) + tests/test_discover_hardening.py (27) + tests/test_citations.py. The builder runs no full suite (suite_runs=0); the checker decides on the full-suite trigger (new dependency touches uv.lock).

## How to verify (commands + expected)
- `uv run ruff check src tests scripts` → expected: All checks passed
- `uv run pytest tests/test_discover.py tests/test_discover_hardening.py tests/test_citations.py` → expected: 101 passed
- `uv run autotester doctor` → expected: `doctor: clean`
- `grep -rniE obsidian pyproject.toml` → expected: no output, exit 1

## Actual outputs (from maker's own run, 2026-10-07)
- ruff: `All checks passed!`
- pytest (three files above): `101 passed in 94.38s (0:01:34)`
- doctor (after `autotester map` and `autotester snapshot`): `doctor: clean`. Caps: discover.py 286, read_context.py 164, text_lines.py 18, credential_files.py 16, ai_target.py 123, test_discover.py 300, test_discover_hardening.py 158.

## Capability coverage (each claim -> a committed test and its isolating falsification)
Every defender below is a node in tests/. Each row's runner line is from a throwaway copy of the tree outside the bound worktree (the maker's scratch driver is not committed), the single named node only: baseline -> mutant -> restored.

Claims dropped from cycle 1 because their defenders were checker scratch oracles, not tests/ nodes: Dataview/backlink/body exclusion "28/28 mutants" (G4-22..24), approval-exception sanitation (test_denial_class_and_formatted_chain_are_safe), and the cycle-1 reader/exec/alias names (now the committed nodes above).

## Live browser evidence
Not UI-touching — no surface changed (src/autotester/schema/ai_target.py, stages/discover.py, stages/read_context.py, prompts/ai_target_classify_v1.md, providers/mock.py, tests/test_discover.py, pyproject.toml). Discovery reads local Markdown and code files only; no browser, network or live model.

## Evidence kept / removed
Kept: results.json per run, probe/mutation scripts, native-tool-receipt.md and the verdicts. Removed (git rm, commit e7033787): 87 raw per-test XML/txt dumps from the four t151-* evidence directories.

## Status: STALLED (HUMAN_GATE qa/gates/t151-cycle2-stalled.md -- A PASS b18e4ea6, B FAIL c5000995 on X17)
