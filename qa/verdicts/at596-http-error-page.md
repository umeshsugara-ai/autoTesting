# Verdict — at596-http-error-page

**Date:** 2026-09-26
**Cycle checked:** 1
**Checked commit:** 6b52c12 (code), manifest 6c7f741
**Checker:** /checker session (claude-opus), Mode D by a fresh claude-sonnet subagent driving its own browser

```
VERDICT: FAIL
SCOREBOARD: 5/6 unit claims met (U5 escaping holds; C5 one-loader holds), 1 regression introduced
FAILURES:
- [claim: "status codes unchanged" / HTTP semantics] sev: medium · a browser-negotiated 405 now ships with NO `Allow` header; JSON callers still get `allow: POST`, and before this unit browsers got it too (FastAPI's default handler forwards `exc.headers`) · `_error_page` (error_pages.py:84-95) builds `HTMLResponse(..., status_code=status_code)` without `headers=exc.headers` -- thread `exc.headers` through (every header-carrying HTTPException: 405 Allow, 401 WWW-Authenticate, custom ones) and add a test that an HTML-accept 405 keeps `Allow` · issue: AT-605
CAPABILITY-COVERAGE: 6/6 distinct rows reproduced (row 7 = same edit as row 4); one-loader claim verified by citation
LIVE-BROWSER: qa/evidence/browser-at596-http-error-page-2026-09-26-checker/ (on master)
ISSUES-WRITTEN: AT-605
EXECUTOR: maker builder (checker: claude-opus session + claude-sonnet Mode D subagent)
EXPLANATION: Everything the unit claims works, live in a real browser, including the two pre-check fixes (Starlette's unmatched-route 404 and approve-on-unknown-slug). The one failure is a regression the unit itself introduced: the HTML branch rebuilds the response and drops the exception's headers, so a browser's 405 violates RFC 9110 §15.5.6 ("MUST generate an Allow header field"). It's a one-argument fix plus one test.
```

## What I re-ran

- `uv run pytest` (full suite, no -q) in the worktree: 1 failed, 1774 passed, 6 skipped, 32 xfailed in 1165 s. The one failure is `tests/test_flake_probe_real_process.py::test_run_once_kills_a_real_hung_process_and_its_real_grandchild` (a nested pytest hit a collection error). It is pre-existing and already tracked (ISS-t164-1, AT-518), and this unit touches no file on its path.
- `uv run ruff check src tests scripts` + `uv run autotester doctor`: ruff: All checks passed. doctor: 1 violation, `ledger-row-lost` for AT-605, only because the branch's ledger predates the row filed on master (f9d9e7b); it clears on merge.

## Capability coverage — reproduced by the checker in its own copies

Each row ran in its own copy (`<scratch>/at596-row<k>`: src, tests, scripts and pyproject, with the worktree venv and
`PYTHONPATH=<copy>/src;<copy>/scripts`). **Every copy was 12/12 green before its edit.**

| row | single-hunk edit in error_pages.py | red after (named tests) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 browser gets themed page | L74 `_wants_html` -> `return False` | 7 failed: all 5 HTML-accept tests + unmatched-route HTML + approve-unknown-slug |
| 2 JSON caller unchanged | L74 -> `return True` | 5 failed: all 4 JSON/no-Accept tests + unmatched-route JSON |
| 3 detail escaped | L89 drop `escape(...)` | 1 failed: `test_html_error_page_escapes_the_detail` |
| 4 secret redacted (also the 6b52c12 row) | L89 -> `escape(detail)` | 1 failed: `test_html_error_page_redacts_a_known_secret_from_the_repo_env` (raw `sk-supersecretvalue123` on page) |
| 5 status code kept | L95 `status_code=200` | 7 failed (every HTML-path test) |
| 6 Starlette base class | L34 -> `from fastapi import HTTPException` | 1 failed: `test_unmatched_route_with_html_accept_renders_a_themed_page` |

**One-loader claim (C5):** verified by citation, as the manifest says a test cannot tell the difference.
`error_pages.py:67` calls `SecretStore.load(...)` (browser/secrets.py:117) and then `.redactor()`
(browser/secrets.py:223). `parse_env` appears only in the docstring (line 52). A missing `.env` is safe: secrets.py:125
reads `""`.

## Diff scope (4c)

`git diff f5dc842..6b52c12 --stat`: docs/MAP.md +1, app.py +2, error_pages.py (new), tests/test_ui_error_pages.py
(new), and the manifest. The diff only adds code: **no pre-existing line removed**, and every file is listed in
"What changed".

## Mode D (own browser, headless=False, port 8071, scratch root)

| # | scenario | result |
|---|---|---|
| A | delete a pinned case (409) | themed "409 Conflict" card; "Back to projects" -> `/` 200 |
| B | `/projects/does-not-exist` | themed 404 |
| C | `/this/route/does/not/exist` (Starlette's own 404) | themed 404 (new in 6b52c12, confirmed live) |
| D | real browser form POST to `/projects/no-such-slug/flowspec/approve` | themed 404 (AT-259 path, confirmed live) |
| E | onboard with a blank name | themed 400 "a project needs a name" |
| F | unvalidated echo `routes_credentials.py:196` (`key` form field) with `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` and with the seeded fake secret value | tag shown as escaped text with no dialog; secret absent, `REDACTED` present |
| G | GET on a POST-only route (405) | themed page renders, **but `Allow` is missing** (see FAIL) |
| H | curl JSON / no-Accept against B, C and D | `{"detail": ...}` and status codes unchanged |

Console: each non-2xx page logs exactly 1 Chromium network line ("Failed to load resource: ... status of NNN") for
the document itself. There were no page-script errors, so this is expected.

**405 reproduced by the checker independently** (TestClient against the worktree, read-only):
`application/json -> 405 application/json allow= POST`; `text/html,... -> 405 text/html allow= None`.

## Contract note

The builder asked whether this handler needs a new U-criterion. **No new criterion yet.** U5 already covers the
escaping, and the header gap is tracked as AT-605. If cycle 2 lands the header fix with a test, the behaviour is
pinned by tests and no contract change is needed.
