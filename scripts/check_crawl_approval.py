"""T-145's done_check (D-018): a live crawl counts as done only if it actually
ran AND a matching human approval covered it.

Replaces `{"cmd": "true"}` — a check that could never fail, on the highest-risk
task in the plan. Exits 0 only when the project has at least one crawl on disk
whose bounds an intact, unexpired `RunApproval` authorised.
