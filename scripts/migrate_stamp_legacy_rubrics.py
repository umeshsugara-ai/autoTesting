"""Stamp `Provenance` on legacy default rubrics, in stored project data.

Before provenance stamping existed (AT-059), `run_case_pipeline.default_rubric`
wrote a rubric with `provenance: null`. AT-059's own fix, `is_stale_default`,
treats an unprovenanced rubric as hand-authored and never touches it -- the
safe direction, but it also means those rubrics can never self-heal: if the
case's rationale is later corrected, AT-059's exact live failure recurs for
them and hand-deleting the file is again the only recovery (AT-065).

A rubric is a migration CANDIDATE only when its `criteria`/`no_fire` are
BYTE-IDENTICAL to what `run_case_pipeline._rubric_for_claim` would produce for
the claim embedded in its own criterion text -- shape alone, never a guess.
Every hand-written rubric in this repo differs in shape (a different criterion
id, different `no_fire` wording) and is never touched; a rubric a human has
since edited, even with `provenance: null` still on it, no longer matches the
template either and is left alone too.

DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. Writing to real project data is a human's call -- AT-065's
own fix direction says "reviewed by a human per file, not an automatic runtime
heuristic", so the dry run always lists every candidate file with the claim it
would be stamped with, and `--only` lets that review land one file at a time:

    uv run python scripts/migrate_stamp_legacy_rubrics.py            # report only
    uv run python scripts/migrate_stamp_legacy_rubrics.py --write    # stamp every candidate
    uv run python scripts/migrate_stamp_legacy_rubrics.py --write \
        --only projects/pathlynks/rubrics/rub_case_35b17ccece2d.json # stamp one file
    uv run python scripts/migrate_stamp_legacy_rubrics.py --root <dir>  # a sandbox

Idempotent: a stamped rubric is never a candidate again (its `provenance` is no
longer `None`), so a second run reports nothing left to stamp.
