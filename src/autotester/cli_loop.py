"""`autotester loop-status` — was the maker-checker loop alive, and if not, on purpose?

AT-368. Separate from `cli.py` because that file is at its line budget and this
command drives a different concern, which is the same reason `cli_issues.py` and
`cli_video.py` are separate from it.

The logic lives in `loop_status.py`; this file is only the terminal in front of
it, so the wording stays testable without a terminal.
