"""The consent gate (D-018): nothing outward-facing starts without a human's
`RunApproval` on disk that is intact, unexpired, and at least as wide as the run.

Gate 1 (`ApprovalKind.READ`) covers reading outside the project. Gate 2 covers
every outward-facing run — the live crawl and, above all, the adversarial pass.

The gate **fails closed and says exactly what is missing**: a refusal that only
says "no" teaches the operator nothing, and the next thing they do is guess.
