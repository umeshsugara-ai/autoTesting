"""Load the repo-root `.env` — one definition, used by every entry point.

AT-228. `ui/app.py` loaded the repo-root `.env`; **no CLI entry point did**. So
`autotester providers` answered `mock` while a working `GEMINI_API_KEY` sat on
disk, and a HUMAN_GATE was filed against a blocker that did not exist. The user
had already supplied the credential and was told the system was waiting on him.

The lesson is not "the CLI forgot a line". It is that *whether this machine has
credentials* was answered differently by two entry points reading the same disk,
and the disagreement was invisible because each was internally consistent. So
this lives in one place (C3) and both callers use it. Parsing is delegated to
`python-dotenv` rather than hand-rolled: the UI already depended on it, and two
parsers for one file format is the same duplication in a smaller costume.

Secrets never pass through here as values — this only populates `os.environ`
from a gitignored file, and `core.redact` remains the gate before any model call.

**It refuses to run inside a test process, and that is load-bearing.** The first
version of this did not, and the suite caught it immediately: every `CliRunner`
invocation ran the CLI callback, which loaded the real `.env` into the shared
test process for good, and four provider tests that assert "no key present"
started passing a real key instead. `ui/app.py` had already solved this by
loading in a lifespan hook rather than at import ("so TestClient(app) never leaks
real .env values into the test process") — moving the load to a CLI callback
re-opened the hole one door over. A repo whose premise is that a secret never
reaches a model, a log or an artifact cannot put real credentials into every
test process as a side effect of testing a CLI.
