"""Secret redaction. Every log line and stored artifact passes through here.

The rule this module exists to enforce: a secret VALUE must never reach a model
prompt, a log file, or an artifact on disk. Only placeholders travel.

Folding internals (Unicode normalisation, homoglyphs, encoded/reversed
spellings) live in `core.redact_fold` -- split out so this file stays under
the C2 line cap; every name anything outside this pair imports is re-exported
here unchanged, so `from autotester.core.redact import ...` keeps working.
