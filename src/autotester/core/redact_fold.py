"""Credential folding: normalise a string so a case, punctuation, homoglyph,

Split out of `core/redact.py` (which was about to cross the C2 300-line cap
implementing AT-347/AT-352/AT-356) because folding is one self-contained
concern -- widening a comparison, never touching stored bytes -- distinct
from `redact.py`'s masking/gating logic. `redact.py` re-exports every name
here that anything outside this pair imports, so no other module's import

needle search (AT-352 cycle 2) -- split out again for the same C2 reason,
and imported here rather than by `redact.py` directly, since it is only ever
used from inside `_contains_folded_secret`.

conforming renderer draws as nothing.

These ranges are only PART of what `_is_ignorable` strips; the `Cf` and `Cc`
categories carry the rest.

AT-351: the first version of this fold stripped `unicodedata.category(c) ==
"Cf"`, which covers U+200B and the bidi controls but NOT U+034F (combining
grapheme joiner) or U+FE00 to U+FE0F (variation selectors). Those are category
`Mn`, they survived the strip and NFKC, and a checker measured them rendering
at 192.5px against a 192.5px plain-credential control — pixel-identical — then
read the credential off the home index in a real browser. Same defect as
AT-345, one code point sideways, on the line AT-345 had just rewritten.

The test has to be INVISIBILITY, not a category -- and the reason is a LEAK,
not the text corruption first claimed here. `fold_credential` only ever
compares; it never rewrites stored text. What stripping all of `Mn` does is
fold the two sides ASYMMETRICALLY, because a stored value tends to carry a
precomposed character while a hostile input carries a decomposed one:

    stored `CAFE_QUILT_APIKEY_31` with a precomposed U+00C9, versus the same
    value spelled `E` + U+200B + combining acute --
      keying on invisibility: both fold to `cafequiltapikey31` (e-acute), MATCH
      stripping all `Mn`:      the spelled form loses its accent,          MISS

which reopens the very class of bypass this fold exists to close. Arabic
shadda U+0651, Devanagari vowel signs and combining acute U+0301 are all `Mn`

the ranges are listed."""

category `Cf`, deleting the character that CAUSES the reordering, and then
compares a string that is not the credential --

    fold("ZEBRA_QUILT_APIKEY_31")  -> zebraquiltapikey31

while a reader sees the credential in plain type, in the correct order. Every
other fix in this family worked by subtracting more; here that makes it
strictly worse, so `ui/helpers.py` REFUSES text containing one instead.

Deliberately just the overrides. U+200E/U+200F (LRM/RLM) and the isolates are
ordinary punctuation in Hebrew and Arabic and do not reverse a pure-ASCII run;
refusing them would cost real input for no gain, and false-positive rate is a
term in this product's north star."""

MIN_FOLDED_LEN = 8
"""Folded matching needs a floor, because folding is a HEURISTIC widening: it
deliberately matches strings that are not byte-equal to any secret, so a very
short folded value would start refusing ordinary text that merely contains its
letters (`A-B` folds to `ab`, which appears in half the English language).
Exact and variant matching stay floorless, so AT-002 -- "a three-character
password is a bad password, but leaking it is still a leak" -- is untouched:
the real value is still refused at any length, by `is_clean`.

AT-352 cycle 3: this same constant also floors `_contains_folded_secret`'s
exact-encoding search (`declared_secret_encodings`), but against the RAW
secret's length, not its folded length -- a different floor on a different
value, reusing the number rather than the meaning. That search is an EXACT
substring match of a computed encoding, not a heuristic widening: a checker
found it pre-filtered by the FOLDED-length floor above (inherited from
`widened_secrets` before either half of `_contains_folded_secret` ran), so a
declared secret whose fold happened to fall under 8 -- one punctuation mark
is enough, `"Zq7!kP2x"` is 8 raw characters but folds to 7 -- got no encoding
protection at all, not even fully isolated. The false-positive argument this
docstring makes for the FOLDED floor does not carry over to the raw-length
one: an exact substring of a computed base64/base32/hex encoding is not
"ordinary text that merely contains a secret's letters" the way a folded
string is, so gating it at all is a deliberate, narrower choice (avoid a
1-2 byte secret's tiny, near-universal encoded fragment), not the same
argument restated."""

    Order is load-bearing. Format characters go FIRST: a zero-width space

    confusable map are trying to see. Then NFKD (full-width Latin, the Kelvin
    sign, other compatibility forms -- decomposed, not recomposed, see AT-356
    below), then the confusable map, then dropping combining marks, then
    separators, then case.

    AT-339: a checker put slug `zebra-quilt-apikey-31` past the guard for the
    live value `ZEBRA_QUILT_APIKEY_31`; it became the on-disk directory name,
    every page URL, and text on the home index. `is_clean` is a plain substring
    test, and `_credential_variants` had learned encoding (AT-074) and
    whitespace (AT-071) but never CASE -- because every test in the suite used
    a value that was already lowercase-with-hyphens, the one casing where a
    substring test happens to work.

    AT-345: the first version of this fold covered only `[\s-_.]` and a plain
    `casefold`, and a checker walked four more forms of the same live value
    into git-tracked files. The worst was a ZERO-WIDTH space between every
    character: U+200B has no width, so the project name rendered as the exact
    credential on the home index -- a human reading the page saw the secret.

    AT-351: and then the same leak reopened through U+034F and the variation
    selectors, because the strip keyed on the `Cf` category rather than on
    whether the character renders. `_is_ignorable` is the corrected test.

    AT-356: `_is_ignorable` deliberately does NOT strip a VISIBLE combining
    mark (U+0301 combining acute, U+0335 combining short stroke overlay) --
    that is the point of AT-351's fix, not a gap in it: stripping every `Mn`
    character BEFORE composition made a decomposed hostile spelling
    (`E` + combining acute) lose its accent while a precomposed stored value
    (`É`) kept its, an ASYMMETRY that MISSED the match. The fix here is not
    "strip more, earlier" but "strip AFTER decomposition, everywhere,
    uniformly": normalise with NFKD (decomposition only, no recomposition) so
    a precomposed stored value and a decomposed hostile spelling both end up
    as bare-letter-plus-mark, THEN drop every remaining `Mn` character. Both
    sides lose the accent together -- no asymmetry -- and a mark that has no
    legitimate base at all (`Z` + U+0335, which no font composes into
    anything) is dropped the same way. A checker's own probe interleaved
    U+034F/U+FE00/U+FE0F (already caught, see AT-351 above) and, separately,
    U+0301/U+0335 between every character of the credential; both render as
    the plain credential and both now fold to it.

    AT-352 cycle 1: `contains_folded` and `assert_no_raw_secrets` used to fold
    and compare only the literal text, so a credential spelled in HTML numeric/
    hex entities, double percent-encoding, or plain reversal passed both the
