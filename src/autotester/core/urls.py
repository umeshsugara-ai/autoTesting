    """Restore the scheme a browser hid, so the host is never read as a path.

    An address bar shows an ABSOLUTE url, and every mainstream browser now hides
    `https://` — so a vision model transcribing one returns `vidysea.com/erp/trainers`,
    not `https://vidysea.com/erp/trainers`. `urlsplit` has no `//` to anchor on
    there, puts the host in `.path`, and `url_template` templates it as a path
    segment: `/vidysea.com/erp/trainers`. That is AT-294, and it is why the same
    screen learned from a video and found by a crawl still did not collapse to
    one row after both producers were switched to `keep_host=False` — the flags
    agreed, the inputs did not.

    Callers holding a genuine relative path must not use this. In practice they
    sometimes do anyway -- an ingest observation is a model's transcription, not
    a validated address bar -- and AT-299b is what that costs: prepending
    `https://` unconditionally makes `urlsplit` read the FIRST segment as the
    host no matter what it is, so `keep_host=False` silently deletes it even
    when it was real path (`erp/trainers` -> `https://erp/trainers` -> `/trainers`,
    losing "erp"; `students/1` -> `/{id}`, losing "students").

    The guard: only treat the first segment as a host when it carries a signal
    an address bar's host actually has -- a domain dot (`vidysea.com`) or a port
    colon (`localhost:3000`). Narrower than the whole-string host-shape guessing
    AT-287's first fix tried and failed at (`settings.json` vs `example.com` --
    genuinely indistinguishable): this only asks whether the first segment of an
    already-multi-part string looks host-like, so a relative path built from
    real segments (`erp/trainers`, `students/1`) carries neither signal and is
    left alone. `localhost/students` is likewise left as a path -- `localhost`
    alone has no dot or colon. Residual, accepted gap: a first segment that
    itself contains a dot (`v1.2/foo`, `settings.json/edit`) still reads as a
    host. A related, separate ambiguity -- a bare dotted/ported token with NO
    path at all (`file.html`, `example.com`) still promotes here and then
    templates to `/`, indistinguishable by shape from a real host's root -- is
    resolved by `screen_url_pattern` below, not here (AT-299b cycle 2).

    `p` this function produced with `keep_host=False`. It is NOT idempotent over
    its own `keep_host=True` output: `urlsplit("demo.test/x")` has no `//`, so
    the host lands in `.path` and re-templating yields `/demo.test/x`.

    That asymmetry is why `Screen.url_pattern` is stored host-LESS by every
    producer (`stages/ingest.py`, `stages/explore_merge.py`,
    `stages/product_map.py`, `stages/screen_identity.py`) — a path pattern, not
    a browsing identity. AT-287: two producers stored it host-ful, coverage
    re-templated it to compare, and the screen became invisible. Inferring
    host-ness back out of a schemeless string is impossible in principle —

    target (`stages/explore_status.py::login_template`) all call this instead
    of each composing `url_template(absolute_url(x), keep_host=False)` and
    re-deciding the None-vs-"/" question for themselves.

    AT-299b cycle 2: that composition alone still turns a schemeless,
    slash-free, dotted/ported token — `file.html`, `example.com`, `report.pdf`,
    `sitemap.xml` — into `/`, a false claim that the site ROOT is covered.
    `absolute_url` promotes such a token to a host (needed so a REAL bare host
    like `example.com` still normalises correctly), and once promoted, a token
    with no path at all is indistinguishable BY SHAPE from a real host's root —
    the same "settings.json vs example.com" ambiguity `url_template`'s own
    docstring already names for AT-287. `absolute_url` must keep promoting
    (turning off promotion would misfile a genuine bare host as a path segment:
    `example.com` -> `/example.com`); the fix is not to stop the guess, but to
    not report `/` when nothing in the raw string actually asked for a root. I7
    already makes `None` the honest, normal outcome for "no pattern is
    knowable" — so this reports None instead, exactly for that one ambiguous
    shape.

    A root is still reported whenever the raw string is not ambiguous:
    `raw == "/"`, a real scheme or scheme-relative input (`absolute_url` left
    it untouched precisely because it already had one), or an explicit
    trailing slash after a promoted host (`example.com/`). Only a bare,
    slash-free promoted token collapses to None instead of `/`.
