"""Design rules over the project's RECORDS, as opposed to its source files.

`doctor` enforces two different kinds of rule and they were living in one module.
The rules in `doctor.py` read `src/` and `tests/` and ask whether the code stayed
readable. The rules here read `docs/FEATURES.jsonl` and `qa/` and ask whether the
project's account of itself stayed true — whether a closed task has a ledger row,
whether an issue a handshake artifact names still exists, whether a PASSed unit's
issue is still open.

Split out under AT-506: three consecutive units (AT-496, AT-500, AT-504) grew
`doctor.py` from 264 to 287 lines against C2's 300-line cap, all three of them in
this half of the file, and `doctor` itself would have stayed silent until 301.
Nothing here changed behaviour — the split is the whole change.

    live manifests when this was fixed: 14 of them wrap, hiding 30 ids. AT-496
    disclosed it as a known limit and four units inherited that framing untested.

    A markdown paragraph is the right unit for a MANIFEST, because that is how they
    are written: the block ends at a blank line or the next block, and every one of
    the 14 terminates that way. Consuming to the end of the paragraph — rather than a
    fixed number of lines — keeps the rule honest when someone wraps to three lines.

    A VERDICT is not a paragraph, and assuming it was is the first thing this got
    wrong. Its block is a run of labelled fields with no blank line between them, so
    `ISSUES-WRITTEN:` is followed immediately by `EXPLANATION:` and several lines of
    free prose. Walking to the blank line swallowed all of it and reported two ids
    that were merely being discussed — the same false-accusation shape as AT-504,
    reintroduced by the fix for AT-509. Hence `_NEW_FIELD`: an ALL-CAPS label ending
