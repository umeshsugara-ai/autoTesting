"""AT-516 (D-048, gate answer c): does a unit's evidence spec (`mutations.json`)
stay runnable, or is it stale -- and if stale, was that decided or did it just
happen?

A later unit sometimes splits or renames the test file a mutation spec's
`kills` node-ids name (AT-506 moved `test_doctor.py`'s record-rule tests into
`test_ledger_checks.py`; AT-513 later moved a block of THOSE into
`test_marker_blocks.py`). The moved-out spec still parses and its bytes never
change -- but `mutation_check.py` refuses to run it (a `kills` node-id pytest
no longer collects fails closed, `mutation_check.py:319-323`), so the evidence
can never be re-derived.

Umesh answered gate `at516-evidence-spec-splitting-policy` with (c) (D-048,
2026-09-26): the spec stays byte-intact -- this module never writes to
`mutations.json` -- and gets a machine-readable tag naming where the test
actually lives now, in a SIDECAR file (`mutations.stale.json`), so a check can
tell "stale on purpose" from "stale because a test quietly vanished". A
tombstone entry counts only if its `moved_to` node-id ACTUALLY resolves in the
current tree; an absent or a lying tombstone is reported exactly like no
tombstone at all -- trusting a tag's presence instead of resolving it is the
vacuous-guard class (AT-218) this project keeps re-discovering.
