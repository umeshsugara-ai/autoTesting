"""Is the maker-checker loop alive, and if it stopped, was that on purpose?

AT-368: `qa/.last-tick` jumped 2026-09-11 straight to 2026-09-16 — 4.85 days,
with 94 open ledger rows and no `qa/.paused`. Nobody noticed, because the only
instrument was a human grepping timestamps out of a prose log after the fact.
The session-start hook does print the last tick's age, but it prints it when a
session opens, and the whole shape of this outage was that no session opened.

So this module does not try to keep the loop alive — nothing in this repo runs
while the app is closed, and pretending otherwise would be the kind of guard
that cannot fail (AT-218). It makes the silence **legible afterwards**: the gaps
are enumerated, measured, and classified, so "the loop slept" becomes a number
this repo can state rather than a thing somebody happens to spot.

Deliberately NOT wired into `autotester doctor`. Doctor is in the adapter's
verify chain, so a stale loop would fail every unit's verification — a liveness
signal that breaks the build is worse than the silence it replaces.
