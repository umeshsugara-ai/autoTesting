"""Split a recording into overlapping chunks a vision model can actually read.

Pure planning here; the encode is `encode_chunks`, which shells out to ffmpeg.
Kept apart because the plan is the part with the interesting edge cases and it
must be testable without a video file or a binary on PATH.

Why overlap at all: a chunk boundary lands mid-action about as often as not, and
a model that sees only the second half of a click reports a screen appearing
from nowhere. The overlap gives the next chunk enough lead-in to recognise what
it walked in on; `stages/adjudicate.py` then drops what it sees twice (A4).

`(overlap_s, chunk_s]` — so at the DEFAULTS (overlap 15 > min tail 10) a runt
tail cannot arise at all. Recorded because a test written at the defaults
appears to exercise this branch and does not: the plan is identical with the
fold disabled, which is how it was found (an INCONCLUSIVE sabotage under C7).
The branch still earns its place — `encode_chunks` is called with a smaller
