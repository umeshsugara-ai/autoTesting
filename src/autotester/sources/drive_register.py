"""Registration for DRIVE sources: `register_drive` -> `Source` rows.

qa/contracts/source-adapters.md DRIVE phase-2 row + SA1-SA6. A folder-scoped
Google Drive listing: the folder itself becomes one DRIVE `Source` (the parent
the files cite), and every file in it becomes a content-addressed CHILD `Source`
of the right kind via the EXISTING adapters -- `register_document`/
`register_audio` (`sources/adapters.py`) and `register_source` (the VIDEO
adapter in `stages/ingest.py`) -- never a re-implementation of extraction (SA1).
Each child carries its Drive file id in `Source.url` and is linked to the folder
via `Source.provenance` (SA4), the `Artifact` envelope every source already
carries; no new parent/child field is invented, exactly as EMAIL did for
attachments. Dedupe is by sha256 of the FETCHED bytes (SA2): the same bytes
fetched twice is ONE Source. A file that cannot be fetched, or whose type no
adapter reads, is still registered -- carrying an `extraction_error` note, never
silently empty or dropped (SA5).

All Drive HTTP and OAuth work lives behind the `DriveClient` seam
(`sources/drive.py`); this module never sees a token (SA3). Split from
`drive.py` for the same reason EMAIL split parse from register: one file per
responsibility, each under the doctor's 300-line rule. A model may later
summarise fetched content for the human, but nothing here lets a model decide
which checks run or alter stored text (SA6).
