"""Deterministic host-side text extraction for DOC sources.

Turns an uploaded document into plain text on the host, with NO model call —
the DOC half of the source-adapter seam (qa/contracts/source-adapters.md,
SA-table + SA5). `.txt`/`.md` are read as UTF-8; `.docx` is unzipped and its
`word/document.xml` stripped of tags (stdlib only — the contract open-question
#1 default, "stdlib-first, no new heavyweight dependency"). Pure-python `.pdf`
text extraction needs a dependency this repo does not yet declare, so it
degrades honestly to an extraction error (SA5) rather than silent empty text —
never a model call that would let a model DECIDE (SA6). Corrupt or unreadable
input also yields an error, never empty text passed off as a real reading.
