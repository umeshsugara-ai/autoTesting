"""COVERAGE: diff what a run actually saw against what the FlowSpec knows.

Contract: qa/contracts/coverage.md V1-V4. "When it meets a screen it does not
know, it asks the human for a video instead of guessing" — this stage is that
mechanism: any URL a run's evidence reached that matches no known screen's
`url_pattern` becomes a `CoverageGap`, and exactly one `VideoRequest` per gap
(both content-addressed, so re-running the diff never duplicates either).
