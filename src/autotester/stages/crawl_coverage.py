"""What a crawl covered, stated by the crawl itself — and every hole, with its reason (V7).

Umesh, 2026-09-16: "puura product map hona chiaye na aend to end testing . each possible
route". A crawl report that lists only what it FOUND reads as the whole product. This
computes, from the graph a crawl already persists (its screens, their controls, and every
attempt edge), how many controls were discovered, how many were really performed, and for
each one that was not, exactly one reason from a closed set.

Pure and post-hoc: the BFS itself is untouched. Every hole is derived from evidence already
on disk, so the figure can be recomputed for any crawl and cannot drift from the graph.
