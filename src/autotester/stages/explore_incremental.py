"""Incremental crawl: don't re-explore a screen the persona already knows.

Contract: qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md CR3 (the skip) and CR5 (a skip is
never silently folded into "explored"). A new module rather than more lines in
`explore.py`/`explore_node.py`, both at the C2 cap.

The cache key is the **Stagehand idea-port** named in
`docs/research/crawl-reuse-2026-09.md` §3 (MIT, idea only — Stagehand is not a
dependency and no code is copied): a step is skipped when the thing it would
act on is provably the same thing it acted on last time. Here that is
`(url_template, structural_signature)` — `PersonaScreen.key()` for the URL half
and `PersonaScreen.signature` for the structural half, both fields that already
existed (`schema/portal_persona.py`).

**The honesty half is the whole point (CR5).** A skip saves work by NOT looking;
it therefore proves nothing about the screen it skipped. So a skipped screen
gets its own `NodeStatus.SKIPPED_UNCHANGED`, is counted apart in
`Crawl.skipped_unchanged`, costs no `actions_used`, keeps every one of its
controls visible as a coverage hole, and stops the crawl's headline reading as
full exploration. A persona-seeded crawl that skips 90% of a portal must never
read as having explored 90% of a portal.
