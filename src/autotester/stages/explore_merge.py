"""Fold a crawl's screen graph into the reviewed FlowSpec (Track B5).

The crawl discovers screens the FlowSpec has never heard of. This stage is the
one place those become `Screen` rows a human can review — and it is deliberately
conservative: an existing screen is never rewritten, a disagreement becomes a
`Conflict` with both claims kept, and any real change sends the spec back to
DRAFT so the human gate is re-armed rather than bypassed.
