"""Getting the browser back onto a screen the crawl has already seen.

Split from `explore_node.py` for the 300-line cap: "try a candidate and
classify where it landed" and "find my way back to this exact screen" are two
jobs, and the second grew its own strategy ladder (back -> the node URL ->
replaying the edge that discovered it -> the base URL) when AT-227 showed that
a screen can exist with no URL that reaches it.

Contract: qa/contracts/explore.md X3, X4 (the replay chain is bounded).
