"""The live state of one crawl in flight — session, store, clock, counters.

Split out of `stages/explore.py`, which sat exactly at the C2 300-line cap when
T-165 needed to add the traversal strategy, the persona index and the typed-
value record to it (qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md, "How a unit is verified":
new logic belongs in a stated-reason new module rather than a file at budget).

This is a pure move plus T-165's new fields. `stages/explore.py` keeps every
behaviour it had — in particular `run_case` still appears there and only there,
inside `_bootstrap_login`, so `explore.md` X1's verify grep is unaffected.

NOT a schema model, for the reason the original docstring gave: it duplicates
no persisted shape (C1). Nothing here reaches disk except through the `Crawl`
envelope and the JSONL the store writes.
