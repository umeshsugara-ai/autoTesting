"""The explorer's inner safety guard (Track B4, D-016).

Umesh's OUTER boundary is the test account's own permissions — whatever the
account can reach, the crawl may reach. This module is the INNER guard he
can loosen (`WritePolicy.ALLOW_WRITES`): by default the explorer never
clicks a destructive-looking control, never submits a form under
`READ_ONLY`, never clicks a logout/sign-out control at any policy, and
never treats third-party noise (analytics, trackers) as a product issue.

Pure logic — no browser, no provider. Contract: qa/contracts/explore.md
X5-X9 (lands at T-143, when the contract itself is written).
