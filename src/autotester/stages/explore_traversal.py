"""Which screen the crawl visits next — the frontier's ORDER, and nothing else.

Contract: qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md CR1 (strategy), CR6 (deterministic,
no provider). A new module rather than more lines in `explore_node.py` or
`explore.py`, both of which sit exactly at the C2 300-line cap; the contract's
"How a unit is verified" section names that split explicitly.

**`bfs` is byte-identical to the original behaviour** — `queue.pop(0)`, FIFO,
the same frontier `explore.py::_bfs` always walked.

**`hybrid` is the Crawljax depth-first candidate ORDERING, ported as fresh
Python** (`docs/research/crawl-reuse-2026-09.md` §1: Apache-2.0, read
permission, idea only — no code is copied and Crawljax is not a dependency).
BFS still maps the portal: every discovered screen is still enqueued exactly as
before, by `explore_node._enqueue`, and nothing is ever dropped from the queue
by this module. What changes is only WHICH queued screen comes off next: having
just entered a workflow, the crawl descends into the screen that workflow led
to, before returning to breadth order. That is why this is not D-023's rejected
single happy-path DFS — D-023 rejected depth-first as the ONLY traversal, a
single line through the portal that never maps it. Here the whole frontier is
still mapped and still drained; only its order differs.

**Termination (X4, `explore.md`, unamended).** `next_node_id` removes exactly
one id from `queue` per call and adds none, on every strategy and every branch.
Ids enter the queue only through `_enqueue`, which is bounded by `max_screens`
and `max_depth`. So the same argument that terminates `bfs` terminates `hybrid`
unchanged, and `hybrid` introduces no bound of its own — X4's four bounds are
the only ones, exactly as CR1 requires.

**Destructive-last, crawl-global (PS2, `permission-surface.md`, D-040 verbatim).**
The second half of this module is the ORDER of a control across the whole crawl,
not across one screen: a control the crawl would press that is destructive by name
is parked by `defer_destructive` instead of pressed, and `drain_deferred` presses
the parked ones only once the non-destructive frontier is exhausted. So every
destructive press comes after every non-destructive one in the exercise sequence.
A screen first reached BY a destructive press is recorded but not explored —
exploring it would put a non-destructive action after a destructive one — and the
crawl says so in `stop_reason` rather than reading "complete". Bounded like any
other action: `drain_deferred` obeys `explore.stop_reason` and adds no bound.
