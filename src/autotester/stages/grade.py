"""GRADE: an independent, stateless judge reads a Rubric + a RawResult's evidence.

The executor never grades itself (core-invariants C7) — this stage never sees the
case's steps or script, only the rubric and the evidence execute.py recorded.
`BLOCKED_HITL`/`ERRORED` outcomes are judged deterministically (there is nothing
coherent to grade); only `COMPLETED` runs reach the judge. The judge's raw answer
is then self-consistency-checked before it becomes a `Verdict` — an unevidenced
failure, or a PASS that doesn't add up, is downgraded to INCONCLUSIVE rather than
trusted. Contract: qa/contracts/grade.md.
