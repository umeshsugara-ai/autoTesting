    - It caught only `(OSError, ValueError)`, while `from_sidecar` raises
      `AttributeError` on a non-object top level and `TypeError` on non-mapping
      segments. The docstring promised best-effort and the code crashed.
    - Returning `None` for an UNREADABLE sidecar made the prompt assert *"no
      speech detected"* about a recording that demonstrably has speech. Silence
      is a fine fallback when it is neutral; it is a defect when it is an
      assertion the reader will believe. So the two cases are now distinct:
      absent → assert silence, present-but-unreadable → say exactly that.
