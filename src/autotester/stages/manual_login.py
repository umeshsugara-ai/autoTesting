"""Manual one-time login. Contract: qa/contracts/manual-login.md ML1-ML5.

Umesh: "for login you should only need id+password — either take it from the
user, or better, open the browser and let the human log in themselves."
This opens the real, visible browser to the project's base URL and waits for
a human to log in by hand — no `SecretRef`/`.env` value is ever read. Closing
the session persists the login into `profiles/<slug>/`, so every later run
reuses it. `.env` auto-fill (`browser/secrets.py`) and the OTP/2FA
`blocked_hitl` pause stay exactly as they are — this is a third, additive
option, not a replacement.
