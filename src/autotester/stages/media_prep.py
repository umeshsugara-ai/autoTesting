"""MEDIA PREP: make a recording readable — probe it, cut it, transcribe it.

Contract: qa/contracts/video-learning.md VL1. Runs on the HOST, never in the
container: the container has no ffmpeg and no GPU, and the 9GB corpus is never
mounted into it. The chunks land under `projects/<slug>/sources/<id>/` which the
container sees through the existing bind mount, so the two halves meet on disk
and nowhere else.

VL1's rule is that this stage DEGRADES, never crashes. Without ffmpeg it emits a
single chunk pointing at the original file — one long video a model can still
watch whole. Without whisper it emits an empty `Transcript`, which the ingest
prompt renders as "no speech detected" rather than as silence it has verified
(AT-134). Both are honest, smaller results; neither is an exception thrown at an
operator holding a 40-minute recording.
