"""Fold a freshly ingested FlowSpec into the reviewed one (Track A6, T-135).

This closes the self-extension loop. COVERAGE notices a route nothing knows and
queues a `VideoRequest`; a human records the video; INGEST watches it and
produces a *fresh* `FlowSpec`. Until this stage existed the answer had nowhere
to land: `persist_ingest` refuses to overwrite an APPROVED spec (ingest.md I6)
and its own error text points here — "or merge instead once merge_flowspec
exists". So the ask went out, the video came back, and the gap stayed open
forever, because nothing ever moved a `VideoRequest` off `OPEN`.

Two halves, both deliberately conservative:

- `merge_flowspec` adds what the recording taught and rewrites nothing a human
  already reviewed. A real change sends the spec back to DRAFT so the review
  gate is re-armed rather than bypassed.
- `resolve_requests` closes exactly the requests the merged spec can now
  answer, and `open_requests` surfaces the ones it still cannot — an ask that
  silently disappears is worse than one that stays open.

Contract: qa/contracts/ingest.md I6 (the merge seam it defers to A6) and
qa/contracts/coverage.md V3 (one request per gap, content-addressed).
