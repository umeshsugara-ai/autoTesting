"""ORCHESTRATE: drive the stage pipeline as a resumable learn-or-explore run.

One job — `run_or_resume(project, ctx)` chooses the entry path ONCE (teaching
material -> learn, credentials only -> explore), then runs each not-yet-done
stage in order, persisting a `RunState` checkpoint after every transition so an
interrupted run re-enters the first non-done stage without redoing completed
work. The stages themselves are the existing pure `run(input, ctx) -> artifact`
functions (`stages/orchestrate_runners.py` wraps INGEST/DISCOVER/MODEL); this
module owns only the sequencing, the checkpoint ledger, and the mode choice. It
adds NO new approval mechanism — both paths propose into a DRAFT FlowSpec and
stop at the existing review gate (contract orchestrator.md OR1-OR6, D-036).
