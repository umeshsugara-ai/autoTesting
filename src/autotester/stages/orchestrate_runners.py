"""The concrete stage runners the orchestrator threads — thin adapters over the
existing stages, kept out of `orchestrate.py` so the driver owns only sequencing.

Each factory returns a `StageRunner` closure `(ctx, prev_ref) -> new_ref` that
reads only the previous stage's artifact, runs the EXISTING stage, persists its
own typed artifact under the run's directory, and returns the reference (OR6):

- INGEST wraps `stages/ingest.py::ingest_video` (the learn entry).
- DISCOVER wraps the bounded-BFS explore path + `merge_screens` (the explore
  entry); the crawl itself is injected as `crawl_fn` so this stays an adapter.
- MODEL folds the entry stage's proposed FlowSpec into the reviewed one via
  `merge_flowspec` — the single seam that resets to DRAFT and refuses to discard
  an APPROVED spec — so no run ever raw-overwrites approved truth (OR3).
