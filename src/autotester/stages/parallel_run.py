"""PARALLEL_RUN: fan N cases out across isolated browser contexts (T-173/D-041).

Today `stages/execute.py::run_case` drives one case at a time on one shared
`BrowserSession`. This module adds the fan-out: up to N cases run at once,
each in its OWN session (its own Playwright `BrowserContext`/storage state,
PR2), where N = min(`project.max_parallel`, a measured RAM/CPU budget, PR1) --
except a project whose `write_policy` is `ALLOW_WRITES` (a shared test
account writes can collide on), which always runs its cases serially (PR3).
A shared `RunBudget` (PR7) keeps `RunApproval` bounds applied to the whole
run, never multiplied per worker, and one case crashing is caught and
reported as that case's own `ERRORED` outcome without aborting its siblings
(PR6). New module, not an addition to `execute.py`: this is fan-out
orchestration, a different concern from running one case's own steps, and
`execute.py` already carries the step-dispatch table at close to its own
line budget (core-invariants C2/C3, parallel-run.md "How a unit is
verified").

Contract: qa/contracts/parallel-run.md PR1-PR7.
