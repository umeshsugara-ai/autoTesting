"""SCORE: compare AutoTester's issues against a human tester's own sheet.

Contract: qa/contracts/video-learning.md (T-136 acceptance). Pure over artifacts
on disk and one workbook — no provider, no network.

This is the north star made arithmetic: *an expert human tester and AutoTester
get the same material and the same build; AutoTester wins on bugs found, false
positives, and time.* Everything before this unit was the machinery; this is the
first module whose output is a number a human can disagree with.

**The two sheets do not share a schema** (measured 2026-09-08,
`.work/track-a-corpus-facts.md`). `ERP_Issues_Trainers.xlsx` has 12 columns and
names the recording `Clip`; `ERP_Issues_ALL.xlsx` has 13 and calls it
`Recording`. T-133's docstring claimed "the scorer accommodates both" while no
scorer existed (AT-201). It does now, and `RECORDING_COLUMNS` is why.

Four measured facts are enforced here rather than remembered, because each one
silently produces a recall of **zero**:

* `At` holds STRINGS like `"00:29"`, not numbers.
* The clip cell is `"erp1.mp4 (Divya Kamboj, trainer pipeline)"` — a filename
  plus who and what, not a filename.
* `ERP_Issues_ALL.xlsx` has **32** data rows, not the plan's 33.
* The corpus lives on `C:`, not `D:`.

    A truth row and an issue can match only when they name the same recording

    time alone would match whatever the model happened to say at that second.
