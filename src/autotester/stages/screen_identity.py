"""Screen identity: turn one `PageObservation` into a `ScreenNode`.

Contract: qa/contracts/explore.md X3 (once that contract exists, T-143).
Deliberately structural — never URL-only (the prior attempt made every SPA
state invisible) and never an LLM's free-text description (its stop
condition then never fired, because the text kept changing). Pure; no
browser, no provider.

    has two different outcomes for the same action. Identity stays with what
