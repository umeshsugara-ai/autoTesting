"""T-191/AT-587 V5: keep at most the N most recent kept videos, project-wide.

`run_and_grade_case`/`_resilient` (`run_case_pipeline.py::_finalize_video`)
already decide whether ONE case's video survives its own verdict. This is
the second, separate prune: across every run a project has, at most `keep`
videos stay on disk in total, chosen deterministically by `(run_id, case
order within that run)` -- never filesystem `mtime` (two videos written in
the same second are indistinguishable by mtime; `run_id` is a ULID and
already sorts lexicographically by creation time, `core/ids.py::run_id`).

Called once per completed run (`ui/routes_runs.py::trigger_run`), not per
case -- retention is a project-wide property, unlike the per-case prune.
