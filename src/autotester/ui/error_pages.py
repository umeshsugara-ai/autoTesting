"""App-wide `HTTPException` -> HTML page, split out of `ui/app.py` to keep that
module under the 300-line design cap. Contract: qa/contracts/ui.md U5.

AT-596: `app.py` registered no exception handler, so every `HTTPException`
raised anywhere under it (400s, 404s, T-184's pinned-case 409) fell through
FastAPI's default handler as a raw `{"detail": ...}` JSON body -- Chrome
renders that as its own built-in JSON viewer: no styling, no nav, no link
back. A browser-driving request (`Accept: text/html`, what every real browser
sends) now gets a page in this app's own visual language instead; a
JSON/API caller -- every existing test that never sets `Accept` gets `*/*`
from httpx, and every fetch that asks for `application/json` -- keeps the
exact JSON body FastAPI already produced, via FastAPI's own default handler,
so no status code, header or JSON shape changes for that caller.

Registered on `starlette.exceptions.HTTPException` (FastAPI's own base class),
not `fastapi.HTTPException` -- Starlette's exception middleware looks a
handler up by walking `type(exc).__mro__`, so registering on the base class
still matches every route's `fastapi.HTTPException` (a subclass) AND
Starlette's own unmatched-route 404 (which is a bare
`starlette.exceptions.HTTPException`, never a `fastapi.HTTPException`, so the
narrower registration this unit shipped at first never saw it) -- a checker
pre-check caught this before Fix cycle 1 closed.
