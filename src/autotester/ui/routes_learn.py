"""The learning loop on screen — review the FlowSpec, generate cases, see the asks.

Contract: qa/contracts/ui.md (U1-U6), review-gate R1-R3, expand.md X1.

**AT-241 — the cold start was a dead end.** A freshly onboarded product's only
route to being runnable was hand-writing cases one at a time. INGEST was
CLI-only, the review gate was CLI-only, and EXPAND — the feature this repo's own
ledger calls "the differentiator" — had no entry point at all. So T-100's
acceptance note, *"full onboarding → report without touching the CLI"*, was
false, and the business-truth campaign proved it by driving the real UI.

Three surfaces close that loop:

* **the review page** — what the system thinks it learned, and the gate, which
  swings **both ways**. A review page with only an Approve button is a rubber
  stamp, not a gate.
* **Generate cases** — EXPAND's button. Persisting stays with the caller because
  expand.md's no-fire list puts it there, so this route saves what it gets.
* **the request queue** — the first place the product's "ask me for a video"
  promise is visible to the human it is asking. A `VideoRequest` written to a
  file nothing renders is indistinguishable from not asking.

Plain server-rendered HTML, no JS framework (ui.md's no-fire list), matching
`routes_cases.py`.
