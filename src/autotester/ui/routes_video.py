"""Serves a kept run video (T-191 evidence) by its evidence-relative path --
the one job this module has (ISS-t191-run-video-2). Before this route
existed, a FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE case's video was recorded and retained but no
verified path reached it: `download_report_html` writes its export to an
OS-temp path so the relative `href` `report_export.py::_video_link_html`
emits never resolves there, and `ui/routes_report.py::run_view`'s
`_step_flow` renders `EvidenceKind.SCREENSHOT` only. This is the actual
working path; `run_view` links to it (`ui/routes_report.py::_video_section`).

    """Resolve an `Evidence.path`-shaped identifier against its run
    directory and refuse anything that would land outside it. `video_path`
    arrives verbatim from the URL -- an attacker-controlled string -- so a
    `..` segment, an absolute or drive-rooted path, a URL-decoded traversal,
    or a symlink planted under `run_dir` must all fail closed here, never
    resolve to a file outside `run_dir`. `Path.resolve()` both normalizes
    `..`/`.` segments and follows any symlink along the way, so containment
    is decided by one `is_relative_to` check against the resolved root --
    same shape `report_export.png_base64` already uses for screenshots.
    Serves only `.webm` (the one container this feature produces), never a
    generic serve-any-file-under-run_dir route.

    A leading slash/backslash or an embedded `:` is rejected by a plain
    string check BEFORE any `Path.resolve()` call touches `video_path`
    (senior-software-engineer review, this cycle): a UNC-shaped value such
    as `\\\\host\\share\\x.webm` joined onto a Windows `Path` and resolved
    makes the OS attempt a real SMB connection to `host` -- a blocking
    network round-trip (measured ~21s against an unreachable host) that a
    later `is_relative_to` containment check is too late to prevent. The
    same check also covers POSIX-absolute (`/etc/passwd`) and drive-rooted
    (`C:\\Windows\\...`) values, none of which a relative evidence path
    would ever legitimately contain.
