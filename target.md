# AutoTester — Target & Roadmap

**What this file is.** The human-readable roadmap: what is *shipped* vs what is *target*, as a
step-by-step checklist, so any session (human or agent) can open it and know exactly where we are
and what is next. The machine backlog with done-checks is `.goal/goal.json` (55 tasks); this is the
milestone view over it. Open me at session start alongside `docs/SNAPSHOT.md`.

**Legend.** `[x]` ✅ shipped & checker-verified · `[~]` 🟡 shipped, proven on fixtures only (not yet
on a real product) · `[!]` 🔒 blocked on a human input · `[ ]` 🎯 target, not built yet.

**Read the honesty rule first:** a box is ticked only when the code exists AND a checker/test proved
it. Coverage never counts an unexplored branch as tested. Goal statements say "AutoTester **will**";
status statements say "currently does".

## The two-layer goal

### North Star (the one line)
> **Give AutoTester a product, not a test script.** It will independently discover how the product
> works, systematically explore its meaningful states and branches, decide what is working or
> suspicious, preserve evidence of every failure, and re-verify the product after every release.

### Two sentences to remember
- **Vision:** explore the product like a *graph*, not a *journey*.
- **Proof:** find the same real defects as a strong human tester — with fewer false positives,
  transparent coverage, and reproducible evidence.

### Product goal (full, "AutoTester will…")
AutoTester will be an autonomous end-to-end software-testing platform that can learn, explore and
validate a web application with minimal prior knowledge. Given a URL, scoped test credentials and
optional evidence (business flows, requirements, videos, screenshots, docs, existing test cases), it
will progressively build a persistent model of the application's screens, states, actions and
workflows. Rather than following one likely journey, it will maintain the application's **unexplored
testing frontier**: every meaningful action from a state is either exercised or explicitly accounted
for as pending / blocked / unsafe / unsupported / intentionally skipped — never silently dropped.
The engine will combine bounded graph-exploration strategies (breadth-first discovery, deeper
workflow traversal, structural state deduplication, loop detection, reliable backtracking & state
restoration, risk-based prioritisation). For each workflow it will test the expected path plus
negative, boundary, edge, permission, recovery and adversarial scenarios. Where verified business
knowledge exists it is the explicit **oracle**; where it is absent, AutoTester runs in discovery
mode and clearly separates confirmed regressions from AI-inferred suspicion. Every action yields
traceable evidence (what was attempted, prior state, what changed, why it was classified as it was).
Coverage measures exercised-vs-discovered; untested branches stay visible. After releases it reuses
its product understanding to re-exercise workflows, find regressions, reproduce the exact failing
path, and report failures + remaining gaps. Later versions extend below the UI (API / backend /
infra signals) for authorization, security, reliability, integration and performance defects. First
acceptance targets: Vidysea ERP and Pathlynks. First proof of quality: a measured comparison against
human testers on defects found, false-positive rate, coverage and effort.

---

## The differentiator (BFS/DFS is a mechanism, not the moat)

State-graph crawling is not new (Crawljax ~2010s; QA.tech commercially today). AutoTester's edge is
the **product**, not any one algorithm:

> Exploration quality × Oracle quality × State restoration × Coverage honesty = AutoTester quality

If exploration is great but every oddity is called a bug → useless. If the oracle is brilliant but
only 8% is seen → insufficient. Both must hold together.

---

## Issue classification (the credibility layer) — 🎯 target taxonomy
Every finding must carry exactly one label, so AI inference is never dressed as fact:
`CONFIRMED REGRESSION` · `LIKELY DEFECT` · `SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOUR` · `UX / CONSISTENCY ISSUE` ·
`PERFORMANCE ANOMALY` · `SECURITY CONCERN` · `UNABLE TO VERIFY` · `EXPECTED / PASSED`.
*(Today: execute/grade produce PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE verdicts; the richer taxonomy is target.)*

---

## Target pipeline (DISCOVER + MODEL become first-class)
**Today (shipped):** `INGEST → EXPAND → EXECUTE → GRADE → REPORT/COVERAGE → BENCH`, with crawl/
explore a standalone **Track B** capability that hydrates the FlowSpec — *not* a canonical stage.
**Target:**
```
INPUT → { INGEST(evidence) | DISCOVER(app) } → MODEL(state/action graph) → EXPAND
      → EXPLORATION FRONTIER → EXPLORE+EXECUTE → OBSERVE → GRADE → EVIDENCE
      → COVERAGE → REPORT → LEARN → RE-RUN
```
DISCOVER and MODEL are primary stages, not side features. 🎯 (promotion tracked as T-163.)

### M4 · Exploration engine (Track B) — ✅ shipped, with named gaps
- [x] T-140 observation primitives + actuator choke-point

## THE PROOF (must clear before AutoTester counts as "working on a real product")

### M7 · Real-product trust number — 🔒 human-gated, then 🎯
*Umesh 2026-09-24: prove it on **Pathlynks first**; a second product's test account (ERP or any other)
comes only after that — "not only erp". T-122/T-145/T-136 get re-scoped to "second product".*
- [!] T-122 login case + first logged-in run on the second product — credentials after Pathlynks is proven
- [!] T-145 live bounded READ_ONLY crawl of the second product — needs T-122 + consent (CRITICAL, dual-check)
- [!] T-136 score recordings vs a trainer truth sheet → real recall/FP/time — **needs the truth sheet**
- [x] T-123 medium credential-safety batch — AT-085 `/healthz` + AT-065 rubric stamp ✅ (18ff2a9); AT-086/087 ✅ merged 6e5c806 (checker FINAL PASS + Mode D; gate answered: both a)
- [ ] T-125 test catalog (runnable/blocked + cheap→expensive) — D-039 ✅, contract `catalog.md` DRAFT
- [x] T-126 governance debt sweep — maker side ✅ (allowlist + FEATURES backfill, checker PASS, merged); AT-560 follow-up ✅ merged f94c5c2; closed by checker sweep 2026-09-25
- [x] AT-110 tamper-proof consent approvals (HMAC keyed from `.env`) — ✅ checker PASS cycle 2 + live Mode D, merged 48aba2f
- [x] AT-483 orphaned-crawl liveness — re-landed onto master (2d58215) after its 09-18 PASS never merged

*Status truth: the plumbing is real, but everything downstream of a **learned** FlowSpec is
fixture-proven only. The ERP trust number is the first time AutoTester is measured against a human.*

## THE PRODUCT VISION (reusable platform) — 🎯 target, mostly unbuilt

### M8 · Systematic exploration upgrades
- [x] T-163 resumable learn-or-explore orchestrator + durable per-stage checkpoints (F-045, dual PASS) — ✅ live caller `autotester orchestrate` (AT-575, merged ec98b33)
- [x] T-170 first-party API/network assertions (D-040 split from T-165) — F-047, checker PASS, merged 1fc7276
- [ ] T-165 hybrid BFS→bounded-DFS traversal + frontier completeness + form-input replay + persona-seeded
      incremental crawl + change tracking (D-040; contract `crawl-traversal.md` DRAFT; CRITICAL dual-check)
- [ ] T-171 permission-surface coverage — every reachable control exercised or blocked-with-reason (D-040)
- [x] T-173 parallel case execution — ✅ merged 626fa03 + live UI wiring ef1b043 (at562-564: per-case evidence, crash isolation; checker PASS c3 + Mode D). Open: AT-574 serial-path resilience, AT-570 RunApproval (T-122)

### M9 · Durable product model
- [x] T-164 durable **Portal Persona** JSON + knowledge page + change history (F-046, 3ceb7b9)
- [x] T-162 multi-source adapters (Drive, video, audio, doc, email, text → one evidence model) (F-044)
- 🎯 Knowledge graph = the persona graph extended (screen/control/flow/scenario/case/verdict/API/release;
  JSON, no graph DB) — built inside T-166 (D-041)

### M10 · Compile, re-run, report
- [ ] T-166 traceable eval compiler (rules + scenarios + taught flows + persona + discoveries → best/worst/edge) + KG
- [ ] T-167 commit/release-triggered visible-browser regression — **built on LangGraph 1.x** (D-041)
- [ ] T-168 unified damage-control report (regression diff, API failures, workflows, screenshots, Excel)
- [ ] T-176 persist + replay generated script, semantic locators (competitor A+C, D-041)
- [ ] T-178 atomic failure bundle + case priority p0–p3 + human pruning of proposed cases (competitor D+H+G)

### M10b · Platform & AI-framework layer (D-041, 2026-09-24; Agents row superseded by D-042, 2026-09-24)
| Layer | Choice | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| Workflow graph | LangGraph 1.x, from T-167 (stages migrate only when touched) | T-167 |
| Agents | LangChain Deep Agents lead tester + subagents (explorer, designer, runner, independent grader, reporter), after Wave 1 — T-179..T-181 (D-042, supersedes D-041's no-multi-agent) | T-179 · T-180 · T-181 |
| Skills | prompts as `SKILL.md` | T-175 ✅ merged 9b3fd5e (checker PASS) |
| Tools / MCP | Playwright (deterministic) · browser-use fallback · AutoTester as MCP server + CLI contract | T-177 · T-174 |
| Observability | local redacted `trace.jsonl` → Langfuse self-hosted on a server | T-172 ✅ merged 7975c81 (local trace; live caller = AT-564) |
- Prompts ship as `SKILL.md` skills (T-175) while crawl / run_case / get_persona / get_catalog / capture_network / grade_case / report stay plain tools with deterministic guards (safety, credentials, write-policy) inside them, not left to the model (D-042).
- Refused: "regenerate tests instead of maintaining them". Deferred to Umesh: differential base-vs-head oracle.

### M11 · Adversarial / below-the-UI (Track C)
- [ ] T-150 Track C governance (file ai-target.md + adversarial.md criteria for the checker)
- [ ] T-151 read-only AI-target discovery + deterministic signals + classification
- [ ] T-152 AI check registry + catalog matching · [ ] T-153 behavioural checks graded by the judge
- [ ] T-154 bounded adversarial pass behind consent gate 2 (HIGHEST-RISK unit) · [ ] T-155 unified tiered AI report

### M12 · The finish line
- [ ] T-169 generic two-mode acceptance (rich-teaching mode AND url+credentials-only mode), no CLI,
      measured vs a human on bugs / false positives / coverage / time — **this is "done".**

---

## Definition of done (product-level)
1. ERP trust number exists (T-136): real recall / false-positive / time vs the trainer truth sheet.
2. Both intake modes work on a real target and beat-or-match a human tester (T-169).
3. Every finding is evidence-backed and correctly classified; coverage shows untested branches.

## Progress (from `.goal/goal.json`, 2026-09-26): 45 / 70 done (64% — T-182..T-184 added by the 2026-09-26 meeting review, D-045; T-183 export failure detail done — the roadmap grew by 12 tasks via D-040/D-041/D-042, not a regression). Status 2026-09-25: merged today — AT-110, AT-560, AT-086/087, T-173, T-175, T-172, AT-571, at562-564 live wiring (ef1b043). Open follow-ups: AT-574 serial-path resilience, AT-575 orchestrator live caller, AT-567 file splits, AT-570 RunApproval (T-122). Waiting on Umesh: AT-335 + T-125 builders were stopped. Next: T-179 Deep Agents lead tester (deps done) when RAM allows.
_Machine backlog + done-checks: `.goal/goal.json`. Whole-project screen: `docs/SNAPSHOT.md`._
_Note: rewriting `.goal/goal.json`'s north star or adding DISCOVER/MODEL to `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
is a state change that needs an authorizing `docs/DECISIONS.md` entry first (Lab Protocol) — this
roadmap doc does not require one._
