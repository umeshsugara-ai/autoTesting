"""Find every command this codebase tells a human to run — a helper, not a test.

Three generations of the same defect live in this file's history, and each fix
was beaten by the same weakness: the collector could not say WHERE it found
what it found.

1. **AT-176** — the first version scanned string *literals*, so it missed the
   one site the class exists for. `stages/media_prep.py` builds its advice as

       f"... run `{PREP_COMMAND} " f"{slug} {source_id}` on the HOST first"

   Backtick in one f-string part, command name in a module constant: two AST
   nodes, no single literal containing both.
2. **AT-178** — it required a backtick, so the un-backticked advice in
   `core/consent.py` was invisible.
3. **AT-206** — the renderer built to close (1) could be **deleted whole** and
   the guard still passed, because `PREP_COMMAND`'s own definition is a plain
   `ast.Constant` that yields `ingest prep` by itself, and results were deduped
   to `(file, command)`. The guard could not tell the composed message apart
   from the constant it is composed from.

So every result now carries its **line**. A rendered site and the constant it
interpolates are different lines, which is what lets a test pin the site the
class exists for instead of its ingredients.

Still static — no import, no execution. What it cannot resolve it reports:
`unresolved_in_source` lists every SCREAMING_CASE interpolation it could not
put a value to, because a hole that reports nothing looks exactly like a clean
scan — which is how all three of the above survived a guard written to catch
them.
