"""Walking the shipped CLI surface — a helper, not a test module.

Extracted from `test_cli_surface.py` so both that file and
`test_cli_harness_safety.py` can import it without one test module importing
another (the checker called that acceptable-but-a-smell, and it was only there
because the two files were split at a line cap). Same pattern as
`tests/crawl_fake.py`: pytest does not collect it.

`invocation_for` is itself the subject of a harness-safety test — AT-184 was a
bug in this function, not in a command — which is why it lives somewhere both
can reach.
