"""The cache — VL2/VL2b/VL3. The only part of Track A that spends money.

Every provider here is a spy and every assertion is on the NUMBER OF CALLS,
because "the cache works" is a claim about calls, not about output. Split from
`test_analyze_video.py` at the 300-line cap; that file keeps the behaviour of
the driver itself (narration slicing, refusals, persistence).
