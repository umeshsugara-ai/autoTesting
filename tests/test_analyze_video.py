"""The ensemble driver — VL2/VL3: what it reads, what it refuses, what it saves.

The COST half of this stage — the cache, and the rule that a re-run never
re-spends a provider call — lives in `test_analyze_cache.py`. Split at the
300-line cap along that line, because "does it spend money twice" and "does it
hand each chunk its own narration" are answered by different assertions.
