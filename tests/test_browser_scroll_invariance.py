"""One property, generated shapes: scrolling must not change WHAT is reported.

AT-423. Five separate defects in `visual_order.js` — AT-373, AT-379, AT-392,
AT-408, AT-416 — were all the same mistake, and all five were found by a checker
driving a browser at a shape the maker had no fixture for. Across three fix
cycles every command the manifests listed stayed green while a real false
negative shipped each time: the suite, ruff, doctor, and the mutation specs.

The five share one property:

    the multiset of glyphs `visual_text` reports must not change when the window
    or ANY scrollable container is scrolled anywhere in its range.

A reader can scroll. Anything a scroll can bring into view is text a reader can
see, so a detector claiming to report what a reader sees cannot report a
different set before and after. Every one of the five was a scroll-invariance
failure; AT-379 was literally filed as `equal_before_after=False`.

Two deliberate choices:

**The scrolls are PERFORMED, not computed.** Computing offsets from
`getBoundingClientRect` is exactly the reasoning that got this wrong five times
in a row. This drives the browser and compares what came back.

**The shapes are GENERATED, not imagined.** `tests/fixtures/bidi_site/
scrolled_panes.html` already *is* the AT-416 shape — `overflow:hidden` wrapping
`overflow:auto` — and cannot exhibit the defect only because the inner box does
not overflow. The shape was on screen and the one parameterisation chosen proved
the opposite property. Enumerating the product removes the need for anyone to
guess which corner is the dangerous one.

**Honest limit: the property is ONE-SIDED.** A detector that reported every node
on the page would be perfectly scroll-invariant. It says nothing about false
positives, so it is a floor beneath the "text a reader cannot see is not
reported" assertions in `test_browser_unreadable.py`, never a replacement.
