"""Every command this codebase tells an operator to run must actually exist.

AT-163 → AT-172 → AT-176. Three fix cycles of T-132 went on one message naming
`autotester media prep`, a command the CLI does not expose. Then the same dead
end appeared one command over (`ingest analyze`). Then — after this guard was
built to end the class — a checker pointed `PREP_COMMAND` back at the dead name
and **this test returned zero failures**, because the backtick and the command
name lived in different AST nodes.

So the collector no longer scans string literals. `tests/advice_scan.py` renders
each string the way Python will, substituting module constants, and reads
commands out of the result whether or not they are backticked. That took the
visible surface from 5 sites to 9 — including `ingest prep`, the message the
whole class exists for, which the literal scanner could not see.

Two oracles, because they answer different questions:

* **does it resolve** — registered, and takes the arity implied.
* **does it work** — the causal one: trigger the refusal, run the command it
  names, assert the refusal stops firing. That was designed by a checker after
  I argued no such oracle could exist without encoding the answer in the test
  (AT-174). I was wrong; my premise held only for *static* oracles.
