"""The test harness must not damage the repository it tests — AT-181 / AT-184.

Split from `test_cli_surface.py` at doctor's 300-line cap, by responsibility:
that file is about what the COMMANDS do, this one about what running them all
must never do.

The split earns itself. AT-181 was `uv run pytest` — this project's own verify
command — rewriting the git-tracked `docs/MAP.md` and `docs/SNAPSHOT.md` it
verifies, because the repo-level test took no temp root and `map`/`snapshot`
both write. AT-184 then arrived *from that fix*: a placeholder is not always an
input, so `report excel` created a file called `nonexistent` in the repo root.

Both were mine, and both are about the harness rather than the product.
Contract: `core-invariants.md` C4 (scratch belongs in `.work/`) and C7 (a check
someone else can re-run).
