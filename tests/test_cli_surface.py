"""Every shipped command, driven — AT-177.

The sweep measured what AT-140 actually left behind: **15 of 22 shipped
commands had no test driving them**, including `flowspec approve` — the human
review gate I6 exists to protect — and all three `report` commands, which are
the exact reader surfaces AT-120 through AT-123 were filed against.

AT-140 closed the gap for `explore` and `approve`. This closes the rest, and
the argument is the same one that unit made: a test that calls a function
proves the function works; only a test that runs the command proves the product
does. Nine of this session's findings were that distinction.

Two layers here:

* a **smoke matrix** over all 22 commands — none may answer a wrong invocation
  with a traceback. Cheap and broad, and **much narrower than it looks**: the
  checker measured that only **4 of 22** invocations reached application code
  at all; the other 18 stopped at click's `Usage:` banner, so the assertion was
  about click rather than about autotester (AT-180). Arity is now derived from
  click itself, which takes it to **20 of 22** — measured, not asserted.

  The last two, `ledger add` and `ledger weight`, take a **closed vocabulary**,
  so the placeholder is rejected — correct behaviour, not a gap.

  AT-185: I first left them there and justified it as "valid arguments would
  make them write, which is AT-181 again". **That reason was measurably
  wrong.** `repo_root()` honours `AUTOTESTER_ROOT`, so with the temp root in
  place those writes land in the temp root and the repo stays clean — the
  checker proved it by running `ledger add` and diffing. An honest number with
  a wrong reason attached is still a wrong claim, so the enum value is now
  supplied from click and all 22 reach application code.
* **focused tests** on the surfaces that carry a decision: the review gate, and
  the three reports.

    artifact it might name is absent. Any exit code is fine; a traceback is
    not. An unhandled exception reaching an operator is never the right answer

    AT-181, high, and entirely mine: the first version of this test took no
    `root` fixture, so it ran `map` and `snapshot` against the LIVE repo — and
    both WRITE. `uv run pytest`, the adapter's own verify command, was
    rewriting the git-tracked `docs/MAP.md` and `docs/SNAPSHOT.md` it verifies.
    The checker proved it by appending a marker to SNAPSHOT and watching this
    one test erase it. A verify step that mutates what it verifies is not a
    check anyone else can re-run, which is C7's whole sentence.

    So: `root` pins a temp AUTOTESTER_ROOT, `snapshot` runs with `--print`, and
    `map` is dropped — it has no read-only mode, and a test that needs one is
    not worth a rewritten repo.
