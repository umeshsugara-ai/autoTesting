"""The consent gate (D-018, T-124). Contract: qa/contracts/adversarial.md (to be
authored) + explore.md.

Consent used to be a habit — `write_policy` defaults and HUMAN_GATE files that a
careful operator honoured. These tests are about the cases where care is not
enough: an approval edited on disk, one that expired, one for a different
endpoint, and one that is simply absent while the run starts anyway.
