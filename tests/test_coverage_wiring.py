"""The self-extension loop, wired to a real entry point — AT-240.

`diff_coverage`, `request_for` and `ProjectStore.add_request` were all tested
and all correct, and between them they had **zero** production callers: a
`VideoRequest` had never been created in this product's life, so "when it meets
a screen it does not know, it asks the human for a video instead of guessing"
— the north star's own sentence — never happened.

These tests are deliberately driven through the two routes an operator actually
presses (`POST /projects/{slug}/run`, `POST /projects/{slug}/explore`) rather
than by calling `queue_requests` directly. A test that called the helper would
pass just as well with both call sites deleted, which is precisely the vacuous
shape this repo keeps finding in its own guards (AT-218). The browser and the
crawler are faked; the routes' own control flow is real.
