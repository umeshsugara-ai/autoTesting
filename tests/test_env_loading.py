"""The repo-root `.env` loader — AT-228, and the leak the fix nearly introduced.

Two properties, and the second is the one that bit:

1. The CLI and the UI must agree about which credentials this machine has. They
   did not: `ui/app.py` loaded the repo-root `.env` and no CLI entry point did,
   so `autotester providers` answered `mock` while a working key sat on disk —
   and a HUMAN_GATE was filed against a blocker that did not exist.
2. **Real credentials must never enter a test process.** The first fix put the
   load in a typer callback, so every `CliRunner` invocation in this suite
   loaded the real `.env` into `os.environ` permanently, and four provider tests
   asserting "no key present" silently started running with a real key.

    test could ever observe whether the CLI calls it. The protection made its own
    wiring invisible, which is AT-206's shape (a fix whose removal nothing
    detects) arriving inside AT-228's fix.
