"""`autotester expand` — the first production caller of `stages/expand.py`.

AT-239/AT-250: `expand` is the feature this repo's own ledger calls "the
differentiator", and until this command existed it had **zero** production
callers — `tests/test_expand.py:11` was the only importer in the whole
codebase. Measured consequence: across four real projects the product held 52
cases of which 49 were `happy`, and not one case in its life had been
generated. A stage nothing calls is not a feature.

The oracle here is deliberately the FILE, not the function: `expand()` returns
`Case` objects and (per `qa/contracts/expand.md`'s no-fire list) persists
nothing — so a test that only checks the return value would have passed
happily throughout the entire period the product could not generate a case.
What these tests assert is that `projects/<slug>/cases.jsonl` gains rows.
