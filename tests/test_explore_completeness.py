"""CR5/CR3 — "complete" keeps meaning the frontier was exhausted.

Contract: qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md CR5, carrying forward T-165's own goal
note verbatim: *"Complete means frontier exhausted; any safety/time/action/depth
bound is named as incomplete with every denied, skipped and unreached control
visible."* `explore.md` X4/X16/X18 are unamended; this file is what stops the new
machinery (a second traversal strategy, and a skip that deliberately does not
look at a screen) from quietly breaking that honesty.

The failure this guards against is the one the whole product judges other tools
for: a crawl that stops early, or takes most of a portal on trust, and still
reads as having covered it.
