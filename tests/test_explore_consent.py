"""The crawl consent pre-flight (`stages/explore_consent.py`).

AT-535 (X10-b condition 3): a synthetic-typing run covered by a production
approval is refused BEFORE the browser opens — D-029's four conditions are
enforced where the run begins, and the refusal names the approval's id. The
base capability is untouched: the same approval still covers an ordinary
READ_ONLY crawl, and a dev-environment approval covers typing.

Contract: qa/contracts/explore.md X10-b (condition 3), qa/contracts/coverage.md
(no coverage claim); gate: qa/gates/live-crawl-target.md (Pathlynks dev).
