"""AT-227: an in-page modal on first paint must not silently swallow a crawl.

The prior behaviour, found on a real 35-second Pathlynks run: a "How are you
feeling today?" overlay rendered over the dashboard, `DialogBreaker` never saw
it (it handles NATIVE dialogs; this is ordinary DOM), and `enumerate.js` called
every control behind the veil `visible` because `getBoundingClientRect` and
`getComputedStyle` both say so. The crawl then spent its per-node budget
clicking controls no human could have clicked, learned ONE screen, and reported
`status=completed` with `issues=0` — a blocked crawl indistinguishable from a
complete one.

The fixture site here has the modal the committed `crawl_site` fixture does
not; the AT-227 note is explicit that a self-authored fixture without one could
never have surfaced this.
