"""CR2/CR7 — form-input replay: re-entering a screen that only a typed value opens.

Contract: qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md CR2 (replay) and CR7 (the replay
widens nothing — it passes the SAME X10-b gate a fresh keystroke passes).
`explore.md` X10/X10-b are unamended.

Split from `test_explore_traversal.py` at the 300-line C2 cap: that file owns
the ORDER the frontier is walked in, this one owns re-performing an action the
crawl already performed once. The live half is a REAL Chromium crawl of a
fixture whose target screen is a client-side STATE at the same URL (AT-227), so
`goto` can never restore it and only the replay can.
