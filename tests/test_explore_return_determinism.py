"""AT-335: the modal-crawl flake, made deterministic.

`explore_return.return_to`'s ladder (back -> the node's own URL -> replaying
the edge that discovered it) used to check its fingerprint exactly once,
right after `settle()`'s fixed networkidle+500ms grace. Against a real
browser this lost the dismissed-dashboard screen about 1 run in 14 -- rare
enough that a fix written against it would be unverifiable without a fixture
that lags on purpose, every time (13 of 14 attempts to reproduce it live came
back green; see qa/issues.jsonl AT-335).

`_SlowModalPage` is a real `BrowserSession` wired to a fake `page`, in the
same style `tests/crawl_fake.py` already uses for `explore_node`/`explore`
unit tests. Its dismiss button hides the veil on the REPLAYED click only --
the first dismiss (ordinary exploration, never touches `return_to`'s ladder)
stays instant, so this isolates the one mechanism AT-335 names rather than
also perturbing `explore_node.try_action`'s own edge classification.

Contract: qa/contracts/explore.md X3, X4 (the replay chain, and now its
tolerance, are both bounded).
