"""X10-b cycle-2 fixes (checker verdict, x10b-form-typing cycle 1).

Three checker-found gaps around the typing pre-pass, each pinned by its own
falsifying test: AT-532 (a fill that auto-submits off-domain is refused, not
explored), AT-533 (typing and clicking share ONE per-node budget), and
AT-534 (typing refusals are recorded as policy edges, never silently clicked).
AT-535 (condition 3: production approval refuses a typing run) is in
`test_explore_consent.py`.
