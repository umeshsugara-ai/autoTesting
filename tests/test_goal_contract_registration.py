"""Pins the T-160..T-184 "revised goal contract" registration exactly.

Split from test_goal_done_checks.py once that file passed doctor's 300-line
cap again under AT-638's repair (same reason `test_goal_done_check_shapes.py`
split off earlier): a different responsibility from either half already
there. `is_capable_of_failing`'s predicate correctness lives in the shapes
file; goal.json-scanning guards over ALL tasks stay in the main file; this
file is neither -- it is a one-off snapshot test asserting one specific,
already-closed registration (D-039..D-045, T-160..T-184) is still exactly as
it was pinned, independent of whatever else gets added to goal.json later
(AT-638/ISS-at638-remainder-2: the previous version conflated this with "no
other task may ever be registered", which broke on ordinary ad hoc work).
