"""What `autotester ingest run` ACTUALLY does — AT-125/AT-128/AT-129.

Every test here drives the real CLI. That is the whole point: T-131 shipped
with tests proving `VisionOptions` reached the provider *when passed*, while the
only shipped caller passed `None`. Proving a mechanism works is not proving the
product uses it, and this file exists because I kept making that exact mistake.
