"""What this stage hands to ffmpeg, and what it does when ffmpeg is not there.

AT-170: four behaviours the contract depends on had **no regression guard at
all**. A checker sabotaged each one and every sabotage produced **zero
failures** — reported INCONCLUSIVE per C7, which is exactly right and exactly
why they are still open: the behaviours are correct, and nothing would notice
if they stopped being.

They are grouped here rather than in `test_media.py` because they are one
responsibility: the boundary between this codebase and a program it does not
control. `subprocess.run` is intercepted, so nothing here needs ffmpeg — the
argv IS the artifact under test.
