"""The VideoRequest lifecycle around a merge — `resolve_requests` / `open_requests`.

Split from `test_merge_flowspec.py` at the 300-line cap (C2). That file owns
merge SEMANTICS (what a merge does to a FlowSpec); this one owns what a merge
does to the asks the system has outstanding.

Before T-135, `RequestStatus.FULFILLED` and `fulfilled_by_source` were declared
in the schema and written by nothing anywhere in src/ or tests/ — every request
this system ever made stayed OPEN for life.
