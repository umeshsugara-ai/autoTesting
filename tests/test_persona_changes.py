"""CR4 — new / changed / missing / broken, and CR5's honesty interaction.

Contract: qa/contracts/crawl-traversal.md CR4. `portal_persona.md` PP1-PP6 are
unamended: `_merge` is still add-only, nothing existing is dropped, blanked or
rewritten, and this unit only adds a CLASSIFICATION recorded on the dated
`PersonaRevision` (PP3) beside the prose summary PP3 already required.

The sharpest test here is the one that does NOT report a finding: a crawl
stopped by a bound never saw the whole frontier, so it may not call a screen
`missing`. Turning "we ran out of budget" into "the product lost a screen" is
the exact dishonesty CR5 exists to prevent.
