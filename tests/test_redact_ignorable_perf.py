"""Regression suite for AT-611 (CJK-heavy folded-secret scanning was ~4x
slower than ASCII because the `_is_ignorable` per-character check thrashed a
4096-entry `lru_cache` once a string's distinct code points exceeded it).

Filed against `qa/verdicts/at599-606-redact-wrap-perf.md`, which measured the
regression as a follow-up (AT-611) while confirming AT-599/AT-606 fixed.

Split into its own file rather than added to `test_redact_wrap_perf.py`
(already 209 lines) or `test_redact_obfuscation.py`: this is a third,
distinct concern -- per-character classification speed, not whitespace
handling or the overall scan's asymptotic shape. Synthetic fake secrets only.
