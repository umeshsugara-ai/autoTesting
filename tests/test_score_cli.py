"""The scorer's exit code and its coverage report — T-136.

Separate from `test_score.py` because it answers a different question. That file
asks *is the matching right*; this one asks *can this command fail*, which is the
question T-136's `done_check` rests on.

A scorer that compares an empty issue list to seven truth rows, prints
`recall: 0.0` and exits 0 is AT-100's class — a check that cannot fail — pointed
at the north star's own metric. Today there are no derived issues (no vision
provider is configured), so that is not a hypothetical: it is what the command
does right now, and the exit code is the only thing separating "measured zero"
from "did not measure".

Contract: qa/contracts/video-learning.md (T-136 acceptance).
