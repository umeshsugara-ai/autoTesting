"""Listing, renaming and deleting a project's cases. Contract: qa/contracts/ui.md.

AT-060: `ProjectStore.add_case` is idempotent on the content id, so re-posting
the form with identical steps was silently swallowed while redirecting as if it
had worked. Because `title` sits outside `Case.compute_id()`, that was also the
natural — and silently failing — way a user would try to fix a typo'd title.
Split from test_ui_cases.py once that file passed doctor's 300-line cap.
