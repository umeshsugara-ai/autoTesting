"""Saving a crawl approval says so, and the approvals in force are listed. AT-435.

Found by live-browser validation: "Save crawl approval" redirected back to an
identical page — no message, no list — so a human who could not tell whether it
worked clicked again, and `approvals.jsonl` gained a second, duplicate grant.
Consent is a file a human writes once (D-018); a page that hides the file makes
that impossible to do on purpose.

Split from `test_ui_crawls.py` (at doctor's 300-line cap) along a real seam: that
file proves a grant is saved correctly; this one proves the human can SEE it.
