"""One question: are bidi OVERRIDES refused outright, rather than folded away?

AT-355. `U+202E` followed by a credential written backwards renders as plain
type in the correct reading order, and the guard could not see it *because* it
stripped the override as a format character -- deleting the one character that
causes the leak, then comparing a string that is not the credential:

    fold("ZEBRA_QUILT_APIKEY_31")     -> zebraquiltapikey31
    fold("\\u202e" + its reverse)      -> 13yekipatliuqarbez

Every earlier fix in this family worked by subtracting more. That operation is
exactly wrong here, so this one refuses instead. Refusing is also the only
answer that stays bounded: a reordering character has no legitimate use in a
project name or a case title, so there is nothing to weigh it against.

Scope is deliberately the two OVERRIDES, and the rest of the bidi family is
deliberately untouched:

  - `U+202D`/`U+202E` force direction character by character regardless of
    content. That is what reverses a pure-ASCII credential.
  - `U+200E`/`U+200F` (LRM/RLM) are ordinary punctuation in Hebrew and Arabic
    text. Refusing them would make the guard reject real input, and
    false-positive rate is a term in this product's north star (AT-078 and
    AT-086 are two prior occasions when this guard made a real project
    uneditable).

Contract: qa/contracts/ui.md U8/U9; threat model pending as U11 (see
qa/gates/at355-guard-shape.md).
