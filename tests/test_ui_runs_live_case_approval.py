"""`POST /projects/{slug}/run` requires a `live_case` approval (AT-570, D-018).

Contract: qa/contracts/consent.md + core-invariants C12(b). Before this unit the
UI case-run path checked no approval at all, and `RunBudget(None)` made the
resulting run *unlimited* rather than unapproved.

Two properties per refusal, both asserted by construction rather than read off
the code: (1) the message names WHICH of the three real states refused the run
-- no `live_case` row exists / the row carries no signature / no signing key is
configured -- because an operator cannot fix a denial that will not say what it
is; (2) the run is reported as NOT-RUN, never as a pass: no run directory, no
result and no verdict are written.

Fakes only for the browser and the grader; the route's own control flow is real.
