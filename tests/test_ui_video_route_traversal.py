"""Every attacker-controlled-input refusal for `ui/routes_video.py`
(ISS-t191-run-video-2). `video_path` arrives verbatim from the URL, so each
test here treats it as hostile: `..` traversal, symlink/junction escapes,
an absolute path, a non-`.webm` file, and UNC/drive-rooted values (the
senior-software-engineer review's UNC finding, this cycle -- see
`_safe_video_path`'s docstring in `routes_video.py`). Split out of
`test_ui_video_route.py` (serving/linking/validity) to stay under doctor's
300-line file cap.
